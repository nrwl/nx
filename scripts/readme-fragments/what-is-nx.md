## What is Nx?

🔎 **Powerful and Extensible Build Framework**

### Use Intelligent Build System with Distributed Caching & Distributed Task Execution

Nx is smart. It analyzes your workspace and figures out what can be affected by every code change. That's why Nx doesn't rebuild and retest everything on every commit--it only rebuilds what is necessary.

Nx also uses a distributed computation cache. If someone has already built or tested similar code, Nx will use their results to speed up the command for everyone else instead of rebuilding or retesting the code from scratch.

This, in combination with Nx’s support for config-free distributed task execution, where a command can be split and ran on many machines in parallel, can help teams see up to 10x reduction in build and test times.

### Develop Efficiently at Scale with Nx

Nx helps scale your development from one team building one application to many teams building multiple frontend and backend applications all in the same workspace. When using Nx, developers have a holistic dev experience powered by an advanced CLI (with editor plugins), capabilities for controlled code sharing and consistent code generation.

### Use Modern Tools

Nx is an open framework with plugins for many modern tools and frameworks. It has support for TypeScript, React, Angular, Cypress, Jest, Prettier, Nest.js, Next.js, Storybook, Ionic among others. With Nx, you get a consistent dev experience regardless of the tools used.
