# Nx Documentation Restructure – MVP PRD

## Overview

The Nx documentation site will be restructured to improve onboarding for new users and make technology-specific content easier to find. The MVP will focus on reorganizing the sidebar, optimizing the "Getting Started" experience, and introducing a new "Technologies" section with recipes moved to their relevant technology. The goal is to make the docs more approachable, navigable, and visually modern.

## Core Features

### 1. Sidebar and Navigation Overhaul
- All sidebar sections are collapsible/expandable, with explicit control over which are expanded by default.
- Remove index pages: clicking a sidebar section title expands/collapses it; expanding opens the first doc page automatically.
- Add technology icons to sidebar entries for visual navigation (reuse icons from `/nx-api` where possible).
- Sidebar remains collapsible even when a page is open.
- Update sidebar visual style for a more modern look, balancing enterprise and developer appeal.

### 2. Optimized "Getting Started" Section
- Structure: Introduction, Quick Start, Installation, Editor Setup, How Nx Works.
- Introduction: High-level overview, value proposition, 5-min video, user roles, clear next steps.
- Quick Start: Three sections (Install Nx, Initialize, Learning Path) with visual support and big navigation buttons.
- Installation and Editor Setup: Retain existing content, rename "Editor Setup" to "Editor Integration" (URL unchanged).

### 3. Technologies Section
- New top-level sidebar entry: "Technologies".
- Each technology (e.g., Angular, React, Node, Build Tools, Testing Tools, Mobile, etc.) has its own section with Introduction, Recipes, and API.
- Recipes are moved from the global "Recipes" section into their relevant technology.

### 4. Core Recipes Section
- Core Nx recipes (not tied to a specific technology) remain in a "Core Recipes" section.

## User Experience

- **Personas:** Newcomers, experienced Nx users, and evaluators.
- **Key Flows:** 
  - New user: lands on docs → Introduction → Quick Start → Initializes Nx → Proceeds to Features/Technologies.
  - Experienced user: finds technology-specific recipes or API docs quickly.
- **UI/UX:** 
  - Visual sidebar with icons.
  - Collapsible navigation.
  - No index pages; first doc opens on expand.
  - Modern, clean look.

---

## Technical Architecture

- **Content:** Markdown files reorganized per new structure.
- **Sidebar:** Defined in `docs/map.json`, updated for new hierarchy and collapsibility.
- **Icons:** Use existing or new SVGs for technologies in sidebar.
- **Redirects/Menu:** Update `redirect-rules.js` and `menu.utils.ts` for new navigation and to avoid broken links.
- **No major infra changes**; ensure build/deploy supports new structure.

## Development Roadmap

### MVP Requirements
1. Update `docs/map.json` for new sidebar structure and collapsibility.
2. Refactor "Getting Started" section as per new structure.
3. Create "Technologies" section and move recipes into their technology.
4. Move core Nx recipes to "Core Recipes".
5. Add tech icons to sidebar.
6. Remove index pages; update navigation logic.
7. Update sidebar visual style.
8. Update redirects and menu utilities.
9. Test navigation, links, and content placement.

---

## Logical Dependency Chain

1. Update sidebar structure in `map.json`.
2. Refactor "Getting Started" section.
3. Create "Technologies" section and move recipes.
4. Update navigation logic (collapsibility, icons, no index pages).
5. Update redirects and menu utilities.
6. Visual style update.
7. QA and release.

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Navigation complexity:** Test thoroughly, use fallback redirects.
- **Visual style acceptance:** Get feedback from both new and enterprise users.
- **Recipe misplacement:** Double-check mapping and tagging before moving.
