# Overview  
[Provide a high-level overview of your product here. Explain what problem it solves, who it's for, and why it's valuable.]

# Core Features  
[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
- What it does
- Why it's important
- How it works at a high level]

# User Experience

# Technical Architecture  
[Outline the technical implementation details:
- System components
- Data models
- APIs and integrations
- Infrastructure requirements]

# Development Roadmap  
[Break down the development process into phases:
- MVP requirements
- Future enhancements
- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks]

# Logical Dependency Chain
[Define the logical order of development:
- Which features need to be built first (foundation)
- Getting as quickly as possible to something usable/visible front end that works
- Properly pacing and scoping each feature so it is atomic but can also be built upon and improved as development approaches]

# Risks and Mitigations  
[Identify potential risks and how they'll be addressed:
- Technical challenges
- Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon
- Resource constraints]

# Appendix  
[Include any additional information:
- Research findings
- Technical specifications]
