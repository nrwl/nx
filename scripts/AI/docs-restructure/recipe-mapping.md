# Recipe Mapping for Navigation Restructuring

This document lists each recipe entry from the 'recipes' section of `docs/map.json` and specifies the technology-specific section in 'technologies' where it should be moved. If a recipe does not have a clear technology section, it is marked as 'Unmapped'.
