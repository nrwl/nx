The @nx/jest plugin provides various executors to run tasks on your jest projects within your Nx workspace.
Below is a complete reference for all available executors and their options.

## Available Executors

### `jest`

Jest target options for Build Facade.

**Usage:**

```bash

| `--ci`                        | boolean | Whether to run Jest in continuous integration (CI) mode. This option is on by default in most popular CI environments.

| `--config`                    | string  | The path to a Jest config file specifying how to find and execute tests. If no `rootDir` is set in the config, the directory containing the config file is assumed to be the `rootDir` for the project.

| `--findRelatedTests`          | string  | Find and run the tests that cover a comma separated list of source files that were passed in as arguments. (https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--findrelatedtests-spaceseparatedlistofsourcefiles)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                   |
| `--forceExit`                 | boolean | Force Jest to exit after all tests have completed running. This is useful when resources set up by test code cannot be adequately cleaned up.This feature is an escape-hatch. If Jest doesn't exit at the end of a test run, it means external resources are still being held on to or timers are still pending in your code. It is advised to tear down external resources after each test to make sure Jest can shut down cleanly. You can use --detectOpenHandles to help track it down. |                   |
| `--json`                      | boolean | Prints the test results in `JSON`. This mode will send all other test output and user messages to `stderr`. (https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--json)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |
| `--logHeapUsage`              | boolean | Logs the heap usage after every test. Useful to debug memory leaks. Use together with --runInBand and --expose-gc in node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                   |
| `--maxWorkers`                | string  | Specifies the maximum number of workers the worker-pool will spawn for running tests. This defaults to the number of the cores available on your machine. Useful for CI. (its usually best not to override this default) (https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--maxworkersnumstring)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                   |
| `--onlyChanged`               | boolean | Attempts to identify which tests to run based on which files have changed in the current repository. Only works if you're running tests in a `git` or `hg` repository at the moment.
