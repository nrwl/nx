# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through \`nx\` (i.e. \`nx run\`, \`nx run-many\`, \`nx affected\`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- When answering questions about the repository, use the \`nx_workspace\` tool first to gain an understanding of the workspace architecture where applicable.
- When working in individual projects, use the \`nx_project_details\` mcp tool to analyze and understand the specific project structure and dependencies
- For questions around nx configuration, best practices or if you're unsure, use the \`nx_docs\` tool to get relevant, up-to-date docs. Always use this instead of assuming things about nx configuration
- If the user needs help with an Nx configuration or project graph error, use the \`nx_workspace\` tool to get any errors
