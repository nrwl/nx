# Workspace Nx Package

{{what-is-nx}}

{{getting-started}}

If it's your first Nx project, the command will recommend you to install the `nx` package globally, so you can invoke `nx` directly without going through yarn or npm.

### Serving Application

- Run `nx serve myapp` to serve the newly generated application!
- Run `nx test myapp` to test it.
- Run `nx e2e myapp-e2e` to run e2e tests for it.
