#### Rename `createNodesV2` imports to `createNodes`

`@nx/react` renamed its primary inferred-plugin export from `createNodesV2` to `createNodes`. The `createNodesV2` name is preserved as a deprecated alias for now, but new code should use `createNodes`.

This migration scans every `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.cts`, and `.mts` file in your workspace and rewrites named imports and re-exports of `createNodesV2` from `@nx/react/router-plugin` to `createNodes`.

#### Sample Code Changes

##### Before

```ts
import { createNodesV2 } from '@nx/react/router-plugin';
```

##### After

```ts
import { createNodes } from '@nx/react/router-plugin';
```

Aliases are preserved (`createNodesV2 as cn` becomes `createNodes as cn`), and if a file already imports both names (`{ createNodes, createNodesV2 }`) the redundant binding is dropped.

#### What is not rewritten

Only static `import`/`export` named bindings from `@nx/react/router-plugin` are rewritten. Namespace imports, dynamic `import(...)`, `require(...)` destructuring, and property access such as `plugin.createNodesV2` are left untouched — they keep working through the `createNodesV2` runtime alias. Update those by hand if you want to drop the deprecated name everywhere.
