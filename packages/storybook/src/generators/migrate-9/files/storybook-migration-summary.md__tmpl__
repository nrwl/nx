# Storybook 9 Migration Summary

## Upgrade Storybook packages

The following command was ran to upgrade the Storybook packages:

```bash
npx storybook@latest upgrade
```

## The Storybook automigration scripts were ran

<% if ( hasSuccessfulProjects ) { %>
The following commands ran successfully and your Storybook configuration was successfully migrated to the latest version 9:

<% for (let command of successfulProjects) { %>
- `<%= command %>`
<% } %>

Please make sure to check the results yourself and make sure that everything is working as expected.
<% } %>

<% if ( hasFailedProjects ) { %>
### Some migrations failed

The following commands failed and your Storybook configuration for these projects was not
migrated to the latest version 9:

<% for (let command of failedProjects) { %>
- `<%= command %>`
<% } %>

You can run these commands again, manually, and follow the instructions in the
output of these commands to migrate your Storybook configuration to the latest version 9.
<% } %>

Also, we may have missed something. Please make sure to check the logs of the Storybook CLI commands that were run, and look for
the `❌ Failed trying to evaluate` message or `❌ The migration failed to update` message. This will indicate if a command was
unsuccessful, and will help you run the migration again, manually.

## Next steps

You can make sure everything is working as expected by trying
to build or serve your Storybook as you normally would.

```bash
npx nx build-storybook project-name
```

```bash
npx nx storybook project-name
```

Please read the [Storybook 9.0.0 migration guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)
