Presented by Miroslav Jonas

Monorepos and monorepo tooling have changed a lot in the last few years, adapting to the practical needs of large teams. As development environments have become more complex, with increasing demands for scalability and higher production with fewer resources, modern monorepos can be an extremely effective way to bring order to this chaos.

Join us for our September webinar to learn what monorepo development looks like in 2025, the benefits of smarter monorepos, how to get buy-in from your leadership and teams,
and how Nx makes monorepo development easier and even more powerful.
