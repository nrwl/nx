## About the Workshop

**Dates:** July 29th-30th

**Time:** 12pm - 5pm ET/9am-2pm PT

This is a 2-day deep dive into all things Nx! Instructors from Nx and Push-Based will team up to cover the breadth of tools and techniques needed for any tech lead or individual contributor to be successful optimizing your development workflow with Nx.

We believe that the most effective way to learn is often to get in there and start trying things out yourself, so topics will be presented via short presentations followed by hands-on code labs. Our instructors will work with attendees, offering help to anyone who gets stuck and engaging discussion topics for anyone blazing ahead.

While the course starts with the very basics of Nx, it quickly moves into advanced topics, so attendees of any experience level should come away with new insights.

We’ll cover…

- **Using Nx –** Run Tasks, Task Pipelines, Affected, Caching, Generate Code
- **Enforcing Organizational Decisions –** Configure Module Boundaries, Create a Custom Plugin to Manage Docker Configs
- **Boosting Performance –** Module Federation, Remote Caching, Nx Agents, Optimize Cache Settings, Atomizer, Flaky Tasks

And more! **Every exercise will also include clear action steps for you to try out in your own repository.**
