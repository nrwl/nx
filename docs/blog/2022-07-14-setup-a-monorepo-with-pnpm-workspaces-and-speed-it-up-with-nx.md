description: Learn to set up a monorepo with PNPM workspaces for Remix and React projects, then enhance it with Nx's task scheduling and caching features.
---

In this article we're going to have a deep dive into setting up a new monorepo using [PNPM workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) that hosts a Remix application as well as a React-based library. We will learn how to run commands with PNPM, how to run them in parallel and finally we're going to add Nx for a more sophisticated task scheduling, including command caching and more.

**Important:** If you are already familiar with the setup and configuration of a new PNPM workspace, feel free to skip to the part where we add Nx later in the article.

## Initialize a new PNPM workspace

To get started, let's make sure you have PNPM installed. The [official docs have an installation page](https://pnpm.io/installation) with detailed instructions. I also recommend using something like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) in particular if you have to deal with multiple different versions of NPM/PNPM and node versions.

Let's create a new folder named `pnpm-mono`, cd into it and then run `pnpm init` to generate a top-level `package.json`. This will be the root `package.json` for our PNPM monorepo.

```shell
❯ mkdir pnpm-mono
❯ cd pnpm-mono
❯ pnpm init
```

It is probably also handy to initialize a new Git repository such that we can commit and backup things as we progress in the setup:

```shell
git init
```

At this point let's also create a `.gitignore` file to immediately exclude things like `node_modules` and common build output folders.

```.gitignore {% fileName=".gitignore" %}
node_modules
dist
build
```

## Setting up the Monorepo structure

The structure of a monorepo might vary depending on what you plan to use it for. There are generally two kinds of monorepo:

- **package centric** repositories which are used for developing and publishing a cohesive set of reusable packages. This is a common setup in the open source world and can be seen in repositories such as [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and many others. Those repos are characterized by most commonly having a `packages` folder and which are then commonly published to some public registry such as [NPM](https://npmjs.com/).
- **app centric** repositories which are used mainly for developing applications and products. This is a common setup in companies. Such repos are characterized in having an `apps` and `packages` or `libs` folder, where the `apps` folder contains the buildable and deployable applications, while the `packages` or `libs` folder contains libraries that are specific to one or multiple applications that are being developed within the monorepo. You can still also publish some of these libs to a public registry.

In this article we're going to use the "app centric" approach, to demonstrate how we can have an application that consumes packages from within the monorepo.

Create an `apps` and `packages` folder within `pnpm-mono`:

```
❯ mkdir apps packages
```

Now let's configure PNPM to properly recognize the monorepo workspace. Basically we have to create a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file at the root of the repository, defining our monorepo structure:

```yaml {% fileName="pnpm-workspace.yaml" %}
packages:
  # executable/launchable applications
  - 'apps/*'
  # all packages in subdirs of packages/ and components/
  - 'packages/*'
```

## Adding a Remix application

We should now be ready to add our first application. For this example I picked [Remix](https://remix.run/) but you can really host any type of application in here, it won't really matter.

> _Info: We use the normal_ [_Remix installation & setup procedure_](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1) _here which you can find on their docs page._

Since we want to have the app within the `apps` folder, we need to `cd` into it:

```shell
cd apps
npx create-remix@latest
```

You will be asked for an app name. Let's just go with "my-remix-app" which we'll be using for the rest of this article. Obviously feel free to use a different one. In addition, the Remix setup process is also going to ask you a couple of questions that customize the exact setup. The particular options are not really relevant for our article here, so feel free to choose whatever best suits your needs.

You should have now a Remix app, within the `apps/my-remix-app` folder or whatever name you chose. Remix has already a `package.json` with corresponding scripts configured:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "sideEffects": false,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix build",
    "dev": "remix dev",
    "start": "remix-serve build"
  },
  ...
}
```

Usually, in a monorepo you want to run commands from the root of the repository to not have to constantly switch between folders. PNPM workspaces have a way to do that, by passing a `filter` argument, like:

```shell
pnpm --filter <package-name> <command>
```

Now it happens (at the writing of this article) that Remix's default `package.json` doesn't have a `name` property defined which PNPM wants to run the package. So let's define one in the `apps/my-remix-app/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-remix-app",
  "private": true,
  "sideEffects": false,
  ...
}
```

You should now be able to serve your Remix app in dev-mode by using:

```shell
pnpm --filter my-remix-app dev
```

## Create a Shared UI library

Now that we have our app set up, let's create a library package that can be consumed by our application.

```shell

cd packages
mkdir shared-ui

```

Next, let's create a `package.json` with the following content (you can also use `pnpm init` and adjust it):

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "name": "shared-ui",
  "description": "Shared UI components",
  "scripts": {},
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {},
  "devDependencies": {}
}
```

Note, we declare it as `private` because we don't want to publish it to NPM or somewhere else, but rather just reference and use it locally within our workspace. I also removed the `version` property since it is not used.

As the technology stack I've chosen to go with [React](https://reactjs.org/) (so we can import it in Remix) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (because it can almost be considered a standard nowadays). Let's install these dependencies from the root of the workspace:

```shell
pnpm add --filter shared-ui react
pnpm add --filter shared-ui typescript -D
```

By passing `--filter shared-ui` to the installation command, we install these NPM packages locally to the `shared-ui` library.

> _Info: Be aware that this might potentially cause version conflicts if the React/TypeScript version used by the library package and the consumer (e.g. our app) differs. Adopting a_ [_single version policy_](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/thirdparty/oneversion)_, where you move the packages to the root of the monoreopo, is a possible solution for that._

Our first component will be a very simple `Button` component. So let's create one:

```tsx {% fileName="packages/shared-ui/Button.tsx" %}
export function Button(props: any) {
  return <button onClick={() => props.onClick()}>{props.children}</button>;
}
export default Button;
```

We also want to have a public API where we export components to be used outside of our `shared-ui` package:

```tsx {% fileName="packages/shared-ui/index.tsx" %}
export * from './Button';
```

For sake of simplicity we just use the TypeScript compiler to compile our package. We could have some more sophisticated setup for bundling multiple files together etc with something like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) or whatever you prefer using, but that's outside the scope of this article.

To create the desired compilation output create a `packages/shared-ui/tsconfig.json` file with the following configuration.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "allowJs": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["."],
  "exclude": ["dist", "node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]
}
```

> _In a monorepo it is good practice to extract the common config part into a higher-level config (e.g. at the root) and then extend it here in the various projects. This to avoid a lot of duplication across the various monorepo packages. For the sake of simplicity I kept it all in one place here._

As you can see the `outDir` points to a package-local `dist` folder. So we should add a main entry point in the `shared-ui` package's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "name": "shared-ui",
  "main": "dist/index.js"
}
```

Finally, the actual build consists of deleting some residual folders from the previous output and then invoking the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). Here's the complete `packages/shared-ui/package.json` file:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "name": "shared-ui",
  "description": "Shared UI components",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rm -rf dist && tsc"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^4.6.4"
  }
}
```

Use the following command to run the build from the root of the PNPM workspace:

```shell
pnpm --filter shared-ui build
```

If the build succeeds, you should see the compiled output in the `packages/shared-ui/dist` folder.

## Consuming our shared-ui package from the Remix app

Our `shared-ui` library is ready so we can use it in the Remix application hosted within the `apps` folder of our repository. We can either manually add the dependency to Remix's `package.json` or use PNPM to add it:

```shell
pnpm add shared-ui --filter my-remix-app --workspace
```

This adds it to the dependency in the `apps/my-remix-app/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-remix-app",
  "private": true,
  "sideEffects": false,
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "shared-ui": "workspace:*"
  },
  ...
}
```

`workspace:*` denotes that the package is resolved locally in the workspace, rather than from some remote registry (such as [NPM](https://npmjs.com/)). The `*` simply indicates that we want to depend on the latest version of it, rather than a specific one. Using a specific version really just makes sense if you're using external NPM packages.

To use our `Button` component we now import it from some Remix route. Replace the content of `apps/my-remix-app/app/routes/index.tsx` with the following:

```tsx {% fileName="apps/my-remix-app/app/routes/index.tsx" %}
import { Button } from 'shared-ui';
export default function Index() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you now run the Remix app again you should see the button being rendered.

```shell
pnpm --filter my-remix-app dev
```

If you happen to get the following error, then it is because you need to build `shared-ui` first

```shell
Error: Cannot find module '/Users/juri/nrwl/content/pnpm-demos/pnpm-mono/apps/my-remix-app/node_modules/shared-ui/dist/index.js'. Please verify that the package.json has a valid "main" entry
    at tryPackage (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:353:19)
    at Function.Module._findPath (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:566:18)
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:919:27)
    at Function.Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:778:27)
    at Module.require (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1005:19)
    at require (node:internal/modules/cjs/helpers:102:18)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/juri/nrwl/content/pnpm-demos/pnpm-mono/apps/my-remix-app/app/routes/index.tsx:1:24)
    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1105:14)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1159:10)
    at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:981:32)
```

To build that, run

```shell
pnpm --filter shared-ui build
```

Why? This is due to the symlinks PNPM creates in order to be able to reference and resolve local dependencies. By adding `shared-ui: "workspace:*"` to Remix's `package.json` you instruct PNPM to add a symlink to Remix's `node_modules` folder.

![](/blog/images/2022-07-14/MYLr1kb3cscQo7JW9_Jg8Q.avif)
_PNPM creates a symlink in the local node_modules folder to be able to import local packages_

## Running commands with PNPM

PNPM comes with handy features to run commands across the monorepo workspace. We have already seen how to scope commands on single packages using the `--filter` :

```shell
pnpm --filter my-remix-app dev
```

You can also run a command recursively on all the packages in the workspace using the `-r` flag. Imagine for instance running the build for all projects.

```shell
pnpm run -r buildScope: 2 of 3 workspace projects
packages/shared-ui build$ rm -rf dist && tsc
└─ Done in 603ms
apps/my-remix-app build$ remix build
│ Building Remix app in production mode...
│ The path "shared-ui" is imported in app/routes/index.tsx but shared-ui is not listed in your package.json
│ Built in 156ms
└─ Done in 547ms
```

Similarly you can parallelize the run by using `--parallel`

```shell
pnpm run --parallel -r buildScope: 2 of 3 workspace projects
apps/my-remix-app build$ remix build
packages/shared-ui build$ rm -rf dist && tsc
apps/my-remix-app build: Building Remix app in production mode...
apps/my-remix-app build: The path "shared-ui" is imported in app/routes/index.tsx but shared-ui is not listed in your package.json dependencies. Did you forget to install it?
apps/my-remix-app build: Built in 176ms
apps/my-remix-app build: Done
packages/shared-ui build: Done
```

## Speeding up with Nx

PNPM workspaces come with some basic facilities for running tasks on the monorepo packages, even in parallel. As the monorepo grows, you might want to have a more sophisticated approach that allows to

- run tasks on only the packages that changed
- advanced caching based on file contents to not run anything that has already been computed previously
- remote distributed caching to speed up your CI

This is exactly where Nx can help. It is optimized for monorepo scenarios and comes with an advanced task scheduling mechanism. We still rely on the package installation and package linking mechanism that PNPM workspaces provide us, but use Nx instead to run our tasks in the most efficient way.

## Installing Nx

Since Nx will be used for running operations across the entire monorepo workspace we're going to install it at the root level `package.json`.

```shell
pnpm add nx -D -w
```

That's it.

## Running tasks with Nx

Nx uses the following form to run your commands:

```shell
npx nx <target> <project>
```

`target` is the NPM script in this specific case you want to execute.

Let's try to run the build for our `shared-ui` package using the following command:

```shell
npx nx build shared-ui
```

This produces the following output

```shell
nx run shared-ui:build
  shared-ui@ build /Users/juri/nrwl/content/pnpm-demos/pnpm-mono/packages/shared-ui
rm -rf dist && tsc
  NX   Successfully ran target build for project shared-ui (1s)
```

Nx automatically finds `shared-ui` and runs the `build` script defined in `packages/shared-ui/package.json`.

Similarly, to launch our Remix app, run `npx nx dev my-remix-app`.

We can also run commands in parallel across the projects with:

```shell
npx nx run-many --target=build --all
    ✔  nx run my-remix-app:build (1s)
    ✔  nx run shared-ui:build (1s)
    NX   Successfully ran target build for 2 projects (1s)
```

Or selectively specify projects with

```shell
npx nx run-many --target=build --projects=my-remix-app,shared-ui
    ✔  nx run my-remix-app:build (1s)
    ✔  nx run shared-ui:build (1s)
    NX   Successfully ran target build for 2 projects (1s)
```

> _Note I'm prefixing the commands with_ `_npx_` _which runs the Nx executable in the_ `_node_modules_` _folder. In this way I don't have to install_ `_nx_` _globally. If you prefer doing that, feel free to do so._

## Configure Caching

One of the main benefits of adding Nx to our PNPM workspace is **speed via caching**. [Computation caching](/concepts/how-caching-works) is a feature where different inputs (source files, env variables, command flags, etc.) are collected and a hash computed & stored in a local folder. Next time you run the command again, Nx looks for a matching hash, and if it finds one it just restores it. This includes restoring the terminal output as well as build artifacts (e.g. JS files in `dist` folders).

Not all operations are cacheable, only side-effect free ones are. For example, if you run an operation with the same inputs, it reliably always has to produce the same output. If as part of that operation you call some API for instance, it wouldn't be cacheable because the result of that API might vary given the same input parameters.

In order to enable caching, let's configure our cacheable operations. To do that we create an `nx.json` at the root of our workspace with the following content

```json {% fileName="nx.json" %}
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
      "runner": "nx/tasks-runners/default",
      "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build", "test"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note the `cacheableOperations` array where we specify `build` and `test` . You can add more such as linting.

Having enabled this, if we now run our Remix app build the first time it is executed just as normal and we'll see it takes roughly 1s.

```shell
npx nx build my-remix-app
nx run my-remix-app:build
my-remix-app@ build /Users/juri/nrwl/content/pnpm-demos/pnpm-mono/apps/my-remix-app
remix buildBuilding Remix app in production mode...
The path "shared-ui" is imported in app/routes/index.tsx but shared-ui is not listed in your package.json dependencies. Did you forget to install it?
Built in 163ms
NX   Successfully ran target build for project my-remix-app (1s)
```

If you re-run the same command, it will now be pulled out of the cache and take only a few milliseconds.

```shell
npx nx build my-remix-app> nx run my-remix-app:build  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]
my-remix-app@ build /Users/juri/nrwl/content/pnpm-demos/pnpm-mono/apps/my-remix-app
remix buildBuilding Remix app in production mode...
The path "shared-ui" is imported in app/routes/index.tsx but shared-ui is not listed in your package.json dependencies. Did you forget to install it?
Built in 163ms
NX   Successfully ran target build for project my-remix-app (9ms)
Nx read the output from the cache instead of running the command for 1 out of 1 tasks.
```

You can also see that from the terminal output mentioning "existing outputs match the cache, left as is" as well as at the end "Nx read the output from the cache instead of running the command for 1 out of 1 tasks."

Having caching in place can drastically improve command execution times. It also gets even more useful if the cache is remotely distributed so that it can be shared with CI as well as other developer machines. In the case of Nx this can be done by enabling [Nx Cloud](/ci/features/remote-cache), which comes with 500 hours saved/month for free (no credit card required) and unlimited hours for open source projects.

## Fine-tuning the caching

By default the caching mechanism takes [all project-level files as an input](/concepts/how-caching-works). We might want to distinguish though which files are being considered based on the target that we execute. Example: you might not want to invalidate the cache for the `build` task if only spec files for unit testing got changed.

To illustrate this on our example, run `npx nx build my-remix-app` twice, such that the caching gets activated. Next, change the `README.md` of the Remix project (`apps/my-remix-app/README.md`). If you re-run the Remix app build the cache will be invalidated due to the change of the README file. This might definitely not be a desirable operation.

We can fine-tune the caching by adding a `targetDefaults` node in the `nx.json` and define that the default `input` for the `build` target should exclude `*.md` files.

```json
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
      "runner": "nx/tasks-runners/default",
      "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build", "test"]
      }
    }
  },
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "inputs": ["!{projectRoot}/**/*.md"]
    }
  }
}
```

With this change, MD files would not be considered as part of the cache input whenever you run the `build` task.

> _Note that all path globs are_ **_relative to the root of the workspace_**_. This avoids confusion as the inputs could also be defined at the project level in the_ `_package.json_` _(_[_more here_](/reference/project-configuration)_). You can use the interpolation variables_ `_{projectRoot}_` _and_ `_{workspaceRoot}_` _do distinguish whether the path should be targeting the project specific files or workspace level files._

## Reusing Cache Input Globs

You can also go a step further as you might re-use this glob for excluding markdown files also for a hypothetical `test` target. You can do so by extracting the glob into a `namedInputs` property:

```json
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
      ...
  },
  "namedInputs": {
    "noMarkdown": ["!{projectRoot}/**/*.md"]
  },
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "inputs": ["noMarkdown", "^noMarkdown"]
    },
    "test": {
      "inputs": ["noMarkdown", "^noMarkdown"]
    }
  }
}
```

By adding `^` in front of the `namedInput` we indicate that this should also apply for changes in any dependencies of the project.

## Defining task dependencies (aka build pipeline)

We have seen previously that when running our Remix dev server, but not having compiled the dependent `shared-ui` package first, we got an error when running our Remix app.

```
Error: Cannot find module '/Users/juri/nrwl/content/pnpm-demos/pnpm-mono/apps/my-remix-app/node_modules/shared-ui/dist/index.js'. Please verify that the package.json has a valid "main" entry

    at Module._compile (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1105:14)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1159:10)
    at Module.load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:981:32)
```

To fix it, we had to manually build `shared-ui` first. Normally you want to avoid this, which is exactly why Nx comes with a `targetDefaults` definition (often also denoted as the "build pipeline").

We can define such task dependencies in `nx.json` at the root of the workspace in the `targetDefaults` property.

As the first dependency we want to define that whenever we run the `build` target on a project, all the `build` targets of its dependent projects should be executed first. We can express that by adding an additional `dependsOn` property to the `build` task definition:

```json
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
      ...
  },
  ...
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      ...
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  },
}
```

Similar as we have seen in the definition of the `inputs`, the `^` here denotes that the target should be run on all dependent projects. If you remove the `^`, then the target would be invoked on the same project. That can be useful if you have a `prebuild` step that always needs to be invoked.

Next, we also want to define a targetDefault for our Remix `dev` command, such that first the `build` on all dependent packages (e.g our `shared-ui`) is run.

```json
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    ...
  },
  ...
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      ...
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

Here's the entire `nx.json` file again as a reference point:

```json
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
      "runner": "nx/tasks-runners/default",
      "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build", "test"]
      }
    }
  },
  "namedInputs": {
    "noMarkdown": ["!{projectRoot}/**/*.md"]
  },
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "inputs": ["noMarkdown", "^noMarkdown"],
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

If we now run `npx nx build my-remix-app` we can see that Nx first runs tasks on dependent projects, and only then runs the command we invoked.

_Nx highlights dependent projects being built, but it keeps the main attention to the current task at hand without distracting_

## Running just what changed

In addition to providing caching, Nx also allows to just run what changed in a given branch with respect to a base branch by using the so-called ["affected command"](/ci/features/affected).

```shell
npx nx affected:<target>
```

You can use any target you have defined in your workspace. For example

- `npx nx affected:build`
- `npx nx affected:test`
- `npx nx affected:lint`
- `npx nx affected:publish`

**How does this work?** Nx builds a project graph based on the structure and dependencies among packages in your monorepo workspace. Let's assume the following hypothetical graph:

_Potential graph of a monorepo workspace_

Whenever we run the affected commands on a branch, Nx compares all the commits and relative changes with the base branch. By default that is `main`, but you can fine-tune that in the `nx.json` file:

```json
{
  "affected": {
    "defaultBase": "main"
  }
}
```

If `lib2` gets changed in our feature branch, running tests against the workspace using `affected:test` would only run tests for `lib2` and `appB`.

_Affected projects if "lib2" gets changed_

Be aware however, if we run `affected:build` and we defined a dependency in our `nx.json` indicating that dependent projects need to be built first as well (see section "Defining task dependencies"), then `affected:build` would build

- `lib3`
- `lib2`
- `appB`

It would not build `lib1` or `appA` though.

## Additional features

Besides speed and task scheduling improvements, we also get some additional features by adding Nx to our PNPM workspace. Let's explore some:

## Want to automate the creation of packages?

Once you have a good setup for a package, you obviously want to replicate that as you create new ones. The usual approach: copy & paste and then remove all stuff that's not needed.

That's tedious and potentially error prone. Nx has a concept of "generators", basically code scaffolding which allows you to generate new packages in the monorepo rather than copy & pasting old ones.

If that sounds interesting, here's a walkthrough:

## Dynamic Terminal Output

Running tasks in parallel with PNPM results in quite a messy terminal output. The logs are hard to parse as the messages from the different commands being executed in parallel are interleaved.

```shell
pnpm run --parallel -r buildScope: 2 of 3 workspace projects
apps/my-remix-app build$ remix build
packages/shared-ui build$ rm -rf dist && tsc
apps/my-remix-app build: Building Remix app in production mode...
apps/my-remix-app build: The path "shared-ui" is imported in app/routes/index.tsx but shared-ui is not listed in your package.json dependencies. Did you forget to install it?
apps/my-remix-app build: Built in 176ms
apps/my-remix-app build: Done
packages/shared-ui build: Done
```

When using Nx to run tasks you get a dynamic terminal that shows just what is necessary and most relevant to the current command that has been executed. Running the same parallel build task results in the following output when using Nx:

## Project Graph Visualization

```shell
npx nx graph
```

This launches an interactive visualization of the workspace's project graph with some advanced capabilities of filtering, debugging your workspace structure and more.

> _As a side-note: you can run the project graph on any PNPM workspace, even if you don't have Nx installed. Running_ `_npx nx graph_` _should work._

## Conclusion

We did it! Here are some of the things we covered:

- how to setup a PNPM based monorepo workspace
- create a Remix and shared React library within a PNPM monorepoe
- how to run different commands with PNPM
- how to add Nx & incrementally adopt it in the monorepo
- benefits and features that come with adding Nx to a PNPM workspace
