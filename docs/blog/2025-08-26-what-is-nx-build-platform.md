You know that feeling when you're planning a trip? The excitement of exploring somewhere new, but then reality hits: booking flights, managing hotels, packing luggage. The actual travel is amazing, but all the logistics? Not so much.

**Coding feels exactly the same way.** There's nothing quite like being in flow, solving an interesting problem, and shipping that feature. But then there's everything else: managing build tooling, configuring integrations, optimizing CI pipelines, and babysitting PRs until they're finally review-ready.

This is why Nx exists.

## What is Nx?

**Nx is an open-source, technology-agnostic build platform designed to manage codebases of any scale.** The core premise is simple: **speed up how you work** across every dimension of your development workflow.

This speed comes in multiple forms:

- **Pure technical performance:** Nx delivers fast task execution, only runs what's [affected by your changes](/ci/features/affected), and leverages powerful [caching](/features/cache-task-results) to avoid redundant computation.

- **Reduced cognitive overhead:** Instead of configuring and integrating dozens of different tools (TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, Vite, Docker, etc.), syncing their configurations across multiple projects, or manually coordinating task dependencies, Nx handles the orchestration automatically.

- **Automation of tedious tasks:** [Code generation](/features/generate-code), automated tooling configuration, migrations between framework versions; Nx plugins automate the repetitive work that normally interrupts your development flow.

This acceleration applies everywhere: locally as you develop features, in CI pipelines where every minute saved multiplies across your entire team. More predictable builds mean faster feedback cycles.

## The Core: Technology Agnostic

The Nx core is written in Rust and completely technology-agnostic. This means whether you're working with React, Angular, Node.js, Java, or even PHP applications, Nx provides the same foundational benefits:

- **Efficient task execution** with automatic dependency ordering
- **Smart caching** that speeds up subsequent runs
- **Workspace analysis** that understands your project relationships
- **Clean terminal UI** that makes sense of complex build outputs

**The secret behind all of this is Nx's project graph.** When you drop Nx into any workspace, it builds a comprehensive understanding of your codebase by analyzing import statements, configuration files, and dependency declarations. This isn't just about [visualization](/features/explore-graph), it's about intelligence.

When you run a build task, Nx knows that your `shop` application depends on your `ui` package, so it automatically builds `ui` first. It understands that changes to your shared `utils` library affect multiple projects, so it can determine exactly which projects need rebuilding and which can be skipped entirely. This project graph understanding powers Nx's "affected" detection and ensures tasks happen in the right order, turning complex orchestration into simple, fast commands.

## Enhance DX with Nx Plugins

While Nx Core handles the fundamentals, [Nx plugins](/concepts/nx-plugins) elevate the experience for specific technologies. These optional add-ons are npm packages designed for technologies like React, Angular, Playwright, Java with Gradle, or any other tool in your stack.

The goal is simple: abstract away low-level configuration and provide utilities like code generation and automated migrations. More importantly, plugins **eliminate configuration duplication between Nx and your actual tools**.

For example, when you modify your Vite config to change the output directory, the Nx plugin automatically picks up that change and updates its cache configuration accordingly. Without the plugin, you'd need to manually configure the output directory in both Vite (your actual build tool) and Nx (for proper cache invalidation), essentially duplicating the same information in two places.

The plugins eliminate this duplication. You configure your tools the way you normally would—Vite, Jest, ESLint, whatever you're using—and the Nx plugin automatically syncs that configuration to ensure caching and task execution work correctly. **The result:** you work more with your actual tools and spend less time managing redundant configuration files.

## AI Integration: Your Coding Assistant Gets Smarter

With AI becoming fundamental to software development, there's a growing challenge: larger workspaces offer more potential value for AI assistants, but they also create context problems. Context windows fill up too quickly with irrelevant code, and AI assistants suffer from context pollution where they can't distinguish between what's important and what's noise. Raw code access isn't enough; it's like navigating a city using only street view without a map.

Nx already builds a comprehensive understanding of your workspace: project relationships, dependencies, tool configurations, and organizational boundaries. The [Nx MCP (Model Context Protocol) server](/features/enhance-AI) gives your coding assistant direct access to this intelligence, including workspace metadata, ownership information, available generators with their schemas and relevant Nx documentation.

Instead of just seeing individual files, your AI can now answer questions like "What's the impact of changes in my orders package?" or "Create a new feature using our team's established patterns." Your assistant understands your actual system architecture, can visualize relationships through the Nx graph, and leverages Nx's metadata-rich generators to ensure new code follows your organization's best practices.

## CI That Fixes Itself

Nx doesn't just make you more productive while developing locally; a lot of the scaling happens in CI. If CI is slow, all your local productivity gains are gone.

But CI is exactly where things often get messy: failed tests, flaky builds, waiting for that one test to finally pass. We call this "time to green": **the moment from your first commit until your PR is green and review-ready**.

Nx Cloud integrates directly with your existing CI provider to provide features that dramatically reduce time to green:

- **[AI-powered self-healing CI](/ci/features/self-healing-ci)** that automatically fixes broken PRs
- **[Remote caching](/ci/features/remote-cache)** for faster CI runs
- **[Distributed task execution](/ci/features/distribute-task-execution)** across multiple machines

When you make a mistake in a PR, Nx Cloud can identify the problem, generate a fix, and even apply it automatically after your approval. You get notified in your editor through Nx Console, can review the fix, and apply it either locally or directly to your PR—all without leaving your development environment.

It's not just about the technical implementation of making things fast, but also how these features integrate. The self-healing process connects directly to your IDE through Nx Console, and when the automated fix is applied to your PR, verification runs again using the same caching and distributed execution features—making validation happen in seconds since most tasks are already processed.

## Start Simple, Scale as You Need It

Nx works for solo developers and large enterprises alike. You can start with a personal project or manage hundreds of developers across multiple teams, adding features as your needs change.

**Solo developer:** Get immediate value from fast local task execution, intelligent caching that speeds up repeated builds, and self-healing CI that automatically fixes simple errors so you can iterate fast.

**Growing teams:** As your project and team expand, you need more structure. Pull in Nx plugins to eliminate configuration duplication, create custom generators that codify your team's best practices, and leverage [module boundary rules](/features/enforce-module-boundaries) to maintain clean architecture as your codebase grows.

**Enterprise scale:** When you're coordinating hundreds of developers, Nx provides enterprise-grade features like codeowners management for proper governance, Nx Agents for massively parallel CI execution across multiple machines, and Polygraph for conformance and consistency across your entire landscape of projects and repositories. Learn more about [Nx Powerpack](/nx-enterprise/powerpack) for enterprise features.

The beauty is the incremental adoption. Start with basic task running and caching, then add the features you need when you need them. You're never forced to adopt everything at once, but the full enterprise toolkit is there when your organization is ready to scale.
