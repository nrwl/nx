As AI agents become central to how developers build and scale software, the need for open standards, shared tooling, and transparent governance has never been greater. Today, we're excited to announce that Nx is now a member of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org) and the [Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)](https://aaif.io).

## Building the Future of Agentic AI

The software development landscape is shifting. Agentic AI — autonomous systems that can plan, coordinate, and act across tools and codebases — is quickly moving from research concept to production reality. The companies and communities that define the standards for this new era will shape how millions of developers work for years to come.

The Linux Foundation has long served as the neutral, trusted home for the open source projects that power global infrastructure. The Agentic AI Foundation, formed in December 2025 under the Linux Foundation umbrella, extends that mission into the age of AI agents. Anchored by foundational projects like Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), Block's goose, and OpenAI's AGENTS.md, the AAIF is where the open standards for agentic AI are being built.

Nx is joining both foundations because we believe the future of developer tooling is inseparable from the future of agentic AI, and that future must be open.

## The Intersection of Agentic AI and Build Tooling

Nx has spent years building intelligent tooling that helps developers and teams manage complex codebases at scale. Our monorepo platform is used by organizations worldwide, empowering software developers across the JavaScript, TypeScript, and broader polyglot ecosystem.

As AI agents increasingly operate within these environments — navigating dependency graphs, orchestrating builds, generating and modifying code — the intersection of agentic AI and build tooling becomes critical. Nx is uniquely positioned to contribute to the standards and practices that ensure these agents work reliably, predictably, and at scale within real-world development workflows.

## What's Ahead

By joining the Linux Foundation and the AAIF, we're committing to collaborating with leaders across the ecosystem to advance open standards for agentic workflows. That means participating in working groups, contributing to shared specifications, and helping ensure that the tooling developers rely on every day is designed to work seamlessly with the next generation of AI-powered development.

We're looking forward to working alongside Anthropic, AWS, Google, Microsoft, and the many other organizations shaping this space. The era of agentic AI is here, and we're proud to help build it — together, and in the open.
