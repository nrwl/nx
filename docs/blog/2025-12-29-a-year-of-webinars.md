Did you keep up with our monthly webinars in 2025? As we close out the year, we wanted to take a moment to look back at all discussions we've shared with the Nx community, from tackling CI bottlenecks to exploring the intersection of AI and monorepos to practical strategies for building better and shipping faster.

If you missed any of these sessions (or want to revisit the good stuff), all recordings are available through our [webinar page](/webinar). Here are some highlights from the year:

## CI Performance That Goes Beyond Caching

All too often we see Nx users setting up remote cache but never quite getting around to taking advantage of other Nx features. In **[The Compounding Effect: How Nx Features Multiply Performance Gains](https://go.nx.dev/nov2025-webinar)**, Jeff Cross and Madeline Hennessy dig into the real gains you can get from addressing flaky tests, random failures, and the manual intervention that keeps developers waiting for green builds.

**[James Henry’s August webinar on self-healing CI](https://go.nx.dev/aug2025-webinar)** and the importance of staying on top of your “Time to Green”, is also a great follow-up to The Compounding Effect.

## The AI-Powered Development Revolution

The rise of AI coding assistants prompted us to ask a crucial question: **[Are Monorepos the Answer to Better AI-Assisted Development?](https://go.nx.dev/april2025-webinar)** Max Kless and Victor Savkin explored why monorepos give LLMs the full context they need to generate more accurate, actionable insights. Nx's deep architectural awareness makes AI tools smarter and more effective, turning context from a challenge into an advantage.

## Making the Case for Monorepos

Whether you're advocating for monorepo adoption or defending your existing setup, our September webinar – **[Making the Case for Smarter Monorepos, and How to Not Get Fooled by Myths](https://go.nx.dev/sept2025-webinar)** – cut through the misconceptions and provided practical guidance for getting leadership buy-in in 2025's complex development landscape.

## A Journey Through Nx Past, Present, and Future

If you’re not sure you want to comb through a year’s worth of webinars, our December webinar is a great way to get all the essentials before kicking off the new year. **[An Nx Carol: Past, Present, and Future of Your Monorepo](https://go.nx.dev/dec2025-webinar)**, featured Nicole Oliver, Miroslav Jonas, and Victor Savkin guiding us through an exploration of how Nx evolved in 2025, where we are today, and what's coming next for the platform and the broader monorepo ecosystem.

## Join Us in 2026

As we head into 2026, we're planning even more in-depth sessions covering the latest in monorepo development, CI/CD optimization, and emerging development practices. Whether you're just starting with Nx or you're a seasoned pro, there's something for everyone.

**Ready to level up your development workflow?** [Check out our webinar page](/webinar) to catch up on any sessions you missed, and keep an eye out for our 2026 webinar announcements.
