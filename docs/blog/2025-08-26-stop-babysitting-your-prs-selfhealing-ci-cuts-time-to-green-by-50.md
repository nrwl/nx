description: 'For better or worse, we’re living in the era of the AI agent. These tools bring with them the capacity to push more code than ever before… but what happens then? With AI contributions, you require more oversight, more testing, and more automated quality checks in order to scale efficiently. For many teams, this inevitably leads to CI becoming a bottleneck.

For better or worse, we’re living in the era of the AI agent. These tools bring with them the capacity to push more code than ever before… but what happens then? With AI contributions, you require more oversight, more testing, and more automated quality checks in order to scale efficiently. For many teams, this inevitably leads to CI becoming a bottleneck. How many times have you felt frustrated that your work was effectively done, but you’ve had to spend the next several hours babysitting it to get it in a mergeable state? At Nx, we track this critical but often-overlooked element of software development as your “Time to Green” (TTG). And we’re not just tracking it, we’ve shipped a bunch of killer features to help bring that TTG way, way down.
