In this episode, welcome Nx Champion and Nx Expert, Tine Kondo. Our discussion highlights how Nx is poised to make an impact in the Java space.

We touch on the difficulties larger organizations face when merging PRs in a timely manner, emphasizing how a monorepo alleviates the headache of coordinating multiple PRs across various repositories, and share firsthand experiences and frustrations with traditional multi-repo setups, underscoring the benefits of a unified approach.

In particular, Nx's new plugin: [@nx/gradle](/nx-api/gradle) is of interest, and Tine provides some valuable insight on the impact this plugin can make, as well as the importance for Maven support.
