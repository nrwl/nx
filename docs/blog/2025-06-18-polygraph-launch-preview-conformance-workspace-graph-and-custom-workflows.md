Presented by James Henry

Join us for a demo of the new polygraph features in Nx Cloud, launching this month with Nx Enterprise!

These features are designed to extend some of the powerful benefits of an Nx workspace to multi-workspace environments and take Nx Cloud beyond CI. We'll cover our updated conformance dashboard, how to visualize dependencies across your repos, the new onboarding experience for workspaces that aren’t yet a part of Nx Cloud, and preview how Nx Cloud will be able to fix your code automatically via agentic AI.
