The Nx community is too large to be adequately supported by the Nx team alone. Luckily, there are many people who volunteer their time and expertise to help others and share how they use Nx to solve their problems. We are launching the Nx Champions program as a way of acknowledging the work of key members of the community and supporting them in their ongoing efforts.

### What Does Champion Mean?

Champion is both a noun and a verb and the champion in Nx Champions is intended in both ways. Nx Champions have achieved a champion level of knowledge and expertise in some area of Nx. They also champion Nx to the community through content like blog posts, videos and conference talks or by contributing code through plugins or the Nx repo itself. In addition, they champion the ideas of the community back to the Nx team.

### Who are the Nx Champions?

A full list of Nx Champions is available at [/community](/community).
