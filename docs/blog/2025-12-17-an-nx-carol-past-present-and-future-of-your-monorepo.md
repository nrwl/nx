**Dec 17, 2025 - 2pm ET/7pm UTC**

Presented by Nicole Oliver, Miroslav Jonas, and Victor Savkin

Join us for a special year-end webinar where we’ll take you on a journey through Nx’s past, present, and future to explore the evolution of Nx and what’s coming next.

Whether you’re a longtime Nx user or considering it for your team, this session will give you the full story of where we’ve been, where we are, and where we’re headed—all before the clock strikes midnight on 2025. No visits from Jacob Marley required.

Bah humbug to slow builds and CI bottlenecks—let’s build something better together.
