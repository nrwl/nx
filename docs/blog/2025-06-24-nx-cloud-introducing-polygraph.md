The monorepo approach has proven to be a powerful solution for managing applications and libraries within a single repository. It gives you visibility into the dependency graph of your projects, central management of tooling, and consolidated enforcement of organizational standards. But that visibility and management end at the boundaries of that repo. What if it didn't have to? That's why we‚Äôre excited to announce **Polygraph** for **Nx Cloud**. Polygraph brings the power of monorepo-level visibility and efficiency to your entire organization.

## The Reality of Enterprise Development

Let's be honest about how organizations _actually_ work. You might have a single Nx workspace‚Äîa monorepo with your applications and related libraries. It works beautifully, and you're happy with the developer experience and architectural clarity it provides.

But it's unrealistic to expect an entire organization to collapse into one massive monorepo. You probably have a design system in its own repository because it's used across multiple applications. You have legacy applications that were built before your current architecture standards. There's an authentication client library that lives in its own repo, microservice backends, and different teams working on different applications with their own repositories.

This is completely normal! Google and Facebook might operate with one repository for everything, but you're not Google or Facebook. Most organizations end up with a vast menagerie of repositories, and the challenge becomes managing all of them. You can easily enforce coding standards, tool configurations, and best practices within a single repository, but ensuring consistency across dozens or even hundreds of repositories becomes a manual, error-prone process.

## The Problem: Visibility and Consistency Across Repositories

The unfortunate downsides to scaling an organization are:

- **You lose architectural visibility** - Within your monorepo, you can see exactly how your application depends on your libraries, how different teams' code connects, and what the impact of changes will be. But once you step outside that repository boundary, you're flying blind.
- **Standards become inconsistent** - Coding standards and tool configurations become harder and harder to enforce as your organization grows. You're left to manually check and track compliance which leads to inconsistency.
- **Dependencies become invisible** - You know your frontend application depends on your design system because it downloads it from npm, but that relationship is completely opaque until something breaks.

The result? Teams end up maintaining spreadsheets to track dependencies, writing documentation that's always out of date, and being forced to react to problems as they emerge.

## Introducing Polygraph

Polygraph is a suite of tools built to help large organizations see across repos and enforce organizational standards. Currently, Polygraph has three core capabilities, extending the benefits you get from Nx monorepos to your entire organization. **It even works on repos that don‚Äôt use Nx.**

### Workspace Graph

![Screenshot of workspace graph in Nx Cloud](/blog/images/2025-06-24/workspace-graph.avif)

[**Workspace graph**](/ci/recipes/enterprise/polygraph#workspace-graph) visualizes dependencies between all workspaces and repos, **even repos that don‚Äôt use Nx**. Instead of managing repos in isolation, you can easily see the connections between repos and understand your organizational code structure at a glance.

This visibility helps you:

- **Understand impact before making changes** - When proposing a change in one part of the organization, quickly identify what other parts will be affected.
- **Plan architectural decisions with full context** - Make informed decisions about refactoring, migrations, and new feature development.
- **Improve team coordination** - Teams can see how their work connects to and impacts other teams' projects.

### Conformance: Enforce Standards Across Your Organization

![Screenshot of conformance rules in Nx Cloud](/blog/images/2025-06-24/conformance-rule-results-table.avif)

[**Conformance rules**](/ci/recipes/enterprise/polygraph#conformance) allow you to write language-agnostic rules that apply across all workspaces in your organization. This goes beyond what you can achieve with individual repository tooling‚Äînow you can enforce consistency at the organizational level.
Platform teams can easily publish and enforce coding standards across an entire organization. They can write and publish rules and then quickly apply them across all repos without requiring work from individual teams. **A single platform engineer can drive standards across the entire organization with one tool.**

For instance, you might create a conformance rule that ensures all repositories use ESLint version 9.0. This rule is published to Nx Cloud and can be configured to automatically run across your entire organization, providing centralized reporting on compliance without requiring any local configuration changes.
The power of organizational conformance rules extends to:

- **Security vulnerability management** - Ensure security issues are addressed consistently across all repositories.
- **Dependency management** - Keep third-party dependencies up to date across your entire tech stack.
- **Tool standardization** - Maintain consistent tooling configurations without manual coordination.

### Custom Workflows: Automation Beyond CI

![Screenshot of custom workflows in Nx Cloud](/blog/images/2025-06-24/custom-workflow-repeating-workflows.avif)

[**Custom Workflows**](/ci/recipes/enterprise/polygraph#custom-workflows) enable you to run scheduled tasks, extending automation capabilities beyond traditional CI pipelines. This allows you to run conformance rules and other organizational processes even on repositories that don't use Nx locally. You can run conformance rules to enforce standards, but you can also run data collection tools to make sure you‚Äôre always up to date with the latest information from repos across your organization. These workflows are separate from CI and language ecosystems, so you can run tasks across any repo in your organization, no matter what language or tool it uses.

This means you can:

- **Apply standards to any repository** - Even legacy codebases, that can't be easily migrated to Nx, can benefit from organizational conformance rules.
- **Schedule organizational maintenance** - Run dependency audits, security scans, or compliance checks on a regular schedule across all repositories.

Custom Workflows are built on top of [**Nx Agents**](/ci/features/distribute-task-execution), and enable you to run any task in an on-demand infrastructure. This is just the beginning of what we have planned for this capability. It lays the foundation for **AI-powered refactoring** and **self-healing CI**.

## How Polygraph Changes Enterprise Development

### From Reactive to Proactive Architecture Management

Instead of discovering architectural problems when they cause production issues, enable proactive architecture management. You can see the full picture of your system's dependencies and make informed decisions about changes before they impact your users.

### From Manual Governance to Automated Consistency

Automate consistency across your entire organization rather than relying on documentation, team communication, and manual processes to maintain standards. Platform teams can write best practices once and have them automatically enforced everywhere.

### From Siloed Teams to Connected Organization

Break down the visibility barriers between teams and repositories. Teams gain insight into architecture and team boundaries, making it easy to understand which parts of the organization will be affected by proposed changes.
