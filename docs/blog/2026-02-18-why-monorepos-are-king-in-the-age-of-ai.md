title: "Why Monorepos are King in the Age of AI"
description: "Monorepo architecture has evolved significantly in the past few years, yet the landscape remains confusing with inconsistent definitions, rapidly changing tooling, and implementation patterns that vary wildly across organizations. Meanwhile, teams adopting AI coding assistants are discovering that modern monorepo tooling is uniquely suited to solve the exact coordination challenges they're now facing. For engineering leaders navigating this rapidly transforming space, understanding the advantages of monorepo capabilities can unlock substantial velocity gains (even if a full migration is not in the cards).

This webinar will provide a clear framework for understanding monorepos in 2026, cutting through the noise to explain how they deliver measurable impact. Particularly for organizations working to ship at AI-accelerated speeds."

Monorepo architecture has evolved significantly in the past few years, yet the landscape remains confusing with inconsistent definitions, rapidly changing tooling, and implementation patterns that vary wildly across organizations. Meanwhile, teams adopting AI coding assistants are discovering that modern monorepo tooling is uniquely suited to solve the exact coordination challenges they're now facing. For engineering leaders navigating this rapidly transforming space, understanding the advantages of monorepo capabilities can unlock substantial velocity gains (even if a full migration is not in the cards).

This webinar will provide a clear framework for understanding monorepos in 2026, cutting through the noise to explain how they deliver measurable impact. Particularly for organizations working to ship at AI-accelerated speeds.
