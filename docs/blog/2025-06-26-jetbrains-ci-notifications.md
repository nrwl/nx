We just shipped a JetBrains AI Assistant integration for failing CI pipelines! ðŸŽ‰

The constant context switching between your IDE and browser to check CI results is now a thing of the past. Nx Console brings CI failure notifications directly into your JetBrains IDE â€“ with one-click AI-powered fixes included.

Here's what makes this powerful: when a CI failure occurs, you can instantly open JetBrains AI Assistant with full context. The AI understands your entire workspace structure through our MCP integration, analyzes the failure, and suggests fixes you can apply immediately. This eliminates the need to decipher error logs or hunt through stack traces yourself.
Also check out [Nx Cloud's self-healing CI capabilities](/blog/nx-self-healing-ci) which are in many ways the next step up from this and coming to JetBrains soon.

## How it works

Under the hood, Nx Console periodically monitors your CI runs through Nx Cloud. When a task fails, Nx Console immediately sends a notification so you can inspect the failure. Or, with this release, let AI Assistant take care of fixing it automatically.

Click the "Help me fix this" action, and the AI Assistant opens with a pre-filled prompt containing all the necessary context: error messages, affected files, test outputs, and more. The MCP server provides rich metadata about your monorepo structure, enabling the AI to understand your project dependencies and suggest intelligent fixes that make sense in your specific context.

## Getting started

Setting up CI notifications takes just a few steps:

- Make sure you have [Nx Console for JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21060-nx-console) installed from the marketplace (1.43.0 or later)
- Enable the JetBrains AI Assistant plugin
- Enable the Nx MCP server â€“ just click on the popup notification when it comes [or refer to our guide here](/getting-started/ai-integration#automatic-setup-with-nx-console)

Once configured, you'll receive notifications for any CI failures in your Nx Cloud workspace. The integration works across IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, and other JetBrains IDEs.

This is just the beginning for our AI-powered CI experience. Full self-healing CI integration is coming to JetBrains IDEs soon, where Nx Cloud will automatically process failed tasks and suggest fixes. [Try it out](/blog/nx-self-healing-ci) today and let us know what you think!
