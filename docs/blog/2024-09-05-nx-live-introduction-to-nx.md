In this episode of Nx Live, Zack introduces new Nx team member Mike Hartington to the value of Nx. Together, Zack and Mike build out a full-stack application in their workspace - complete with linting, testing, and end-to-end tests using Nx's generators, and they look at the capabilities that Nx offers in terms of defining their workspace, and how Nx can leverage that information for task-running - especially in CI!
