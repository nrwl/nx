By default Nx captures common folders like `dist` or `build` and automatically restores them from the local cache. However, it doesn't capture the `.next` folder by default.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to fine-tune local caching to ensure proper handling of the `.next` folder. We'll configure the cache outputs to make sure the Next.js build artifacts are properly restored from cache when needed.
