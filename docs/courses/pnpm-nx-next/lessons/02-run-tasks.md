In this lesson, you'll learn how to use Nx to run your PNPM workspace's `package.json` scripts. So rather than running:

```shell
pnpm --filter @tasker/web build
```

you would run:

```shell
pnpm nx build @tasker/web
```

We'll cover the syntax for running both single tasks and multiple tasks, helping you understand how to leverage Nx's task execution capabilities.
