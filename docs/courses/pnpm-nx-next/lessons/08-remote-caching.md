Nx Cloud comes with powerful built-in [remote caching capabilities](/docs/features/ci-features/remote-cache). Security and access control for such a cache is crucial, which is why Nx Cloud provides [various controls for managing read and write access to the remote cache](/docs/guides/nx-cloud/access-tokens).

In this lesson, we'll create an access token in our Nx Cloud workspace configuration to enable read/write access to our Github actions.
