In this lesson, we'll explore how to add Nx to our existing PNPM workspace. You can either add just the `nx` package to your `package.json` and then create a `nx.json` [configuration file](/reference/nx-json), or simply run:

```shell
nx init
```

This process will analyze your repository and ask you a couple of questions to properly set up Nx while maintaining your existing PNPM workspace structure.
