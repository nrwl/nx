Nx powers the “Smart Monorepo,” while Nx Cloud brings “Fast CI” into the mix. Designed to extend Nx’s efficiency into the CI pipeline, Nx Cloud ensures that even large monorepos stay fast and optimized in CI.

In this lesson, we’ll take the Tasker monorepo, push it to GitHub, set up an Nx Cloud workspace, and link it with your GitHub repository. By the end, your Nx workspace will be fully connected to Nx Cloud, ready to leverage its remote caching and distributed CI capabilities.
