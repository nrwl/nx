# Nx 18

We were so excited about the features in Nx 18 that we created a whole [Launch Nx Week](/launch-nx) to share our excitement with you. During the launch week, we made the following announcements:

- [Project Crystal](/blog/what-if-nx-plugins-were-more-like-vscode-extensions) allows you to use inferred tasks
- A new [`@nx/nuxt`](/blog/introducing-nx-nuxt-enhanced-nuxt-js-support-in-nx) plugin is available
- [Nx Agents](/blog/fast-effortless-ci) are publicly available
- [`nx release`](/blog/versioning-and-releasing-packages-in-a-monorepo) is out of beta

## Breaking Changes

Note: Though this is a major version, there are no removals of previous deprecations. Any deprecations which were previously scheduled for Nx 18 are now scheduled for Nx 19 which will still be coming out around April 2024.
