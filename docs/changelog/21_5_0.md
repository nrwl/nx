# Nx 21.5

{% callout type="warning" title="Note about 21.5.0" %}
21.5.0 was published containing malware as part of the [S1ngularity attack](/blog/s1ngularity-postmortem). The compromised version was removed from npm, and we skipped publishing that version again to reduce confusion. You can safely use 21.5.1 and newer.
