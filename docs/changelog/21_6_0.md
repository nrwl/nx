# Nx 21.6

{% callout type="warning" title="Note about 21.6.0" %}
21.6.0 was published containing malware as part of the [S1ngularity attack](/blog/s1ngularity-postmortem). The compromised version was removed from npm, and we skipped publishing that version again to reduce confusion. You can safely use 21.6.1 and newer.
