# watch

Watch for changes within projects, and execute commands.

## Usage

```shell
nx watch
```

Install `nx` globally to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npx nx`, `yarn nx`, or `pnpm nx`.

### Examples

Watch the "app" project and echo the project name and the files that changed:

```shell
 nx watch --projects=app -- echo \$NX_PROJECT_NAME \$NX_FILE_CHANGES
```

Watch "app1" and "app2" and echo the project name whenever a specified project or its dependencies change:

```shell
 nx watch --projects=app1,app2 --includeDependentProjects -- echo \$NX_PROJECT_NAME
```

Watch all projects (including newly created projects) in the workspace:

```shell
 nx watch --all -- echo \$NX_PROJECT_NAME
```
