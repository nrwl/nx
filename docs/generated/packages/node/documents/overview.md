title: Node.js Plugin for Nx
description: Learn how to use the @nx/node plugin to create and manage Node.js applications and libraries in your Nx workspace, including setup, building, and testing.

The Node Plugin contains generators and executors to manage Node applications within an Nx workspace. It provides:

## Setting Up @nx/node

### Installation

{% callout type="note" title="Keep Nx Package Versions In Sync" %}
Make sure to install the `@nx/node` version that matches the version of `nx` in your repository. If the version numbers get out of sync, you can encounter some difficult to debug errors. You can [fix Nx version mismatches with this recipe](/recipes/tips-n-tricks/keep-nx-versions-in-sync).
{% /callout %}

In any Nx workspace, you can install `@nx/node` by running the following command:

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="Nx 18+" %}

```shell {% skipRescope=true %}
nx add @nx/node
```

This will install the correct version of `@nx/node`.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="Nx < 18" %}

Install the `@nx/node` package with your package manager.

```shell
npm add -D @nx/node
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Using the @nx/node Plugin

### Creating Applications

You can add a new application with the following:

```shell
nx g @nx/node:application apps/my-new-app
```

You can run your application with `nx serve my-new-app`, which starts it in watch mode.

### Creating Libraries

Node libraries are a good way to separate features within your organization. To create a Node library run the following command:

```shell
nx g @nx/node:lib libs/my-new-lib

# If you want the library to be buildable or publishable to npm
nx g @nx/node:lib libs/my-new-lib --buildable
nx g @nx/node:lib libs/my-new-lib \
--publishable \
--importPath=@myorg/my-new-lib
```

## Using Node

### Testing Projects

You can run unit tests with:

```shell
nx test my-new-app
nx test my-new-lib
```

Replace `my-new-app` with the name or your project. This command works for both applications and libraries.

### Building Projects

Node applications can be build with:

```shell
nx build my-new-app
```

And if you generated a library with `--buildable`, then you can build a library as well:

```shell
nx build my-new-lib
```

The output is in the `dist` folder. You can customize the output folder by setting `outputPath` in the project's `project.json` file.

### Application Proxies

Generating Node applications has an option to configure other projects in the workspace to proxy API requests. This can be done by passing the `--frontendProject` with the project name you wish to enable proxy support for.

```shell
nx g @nx/node:application apps/my-new-app \
--frontendProject my-react-app
```

### Debugging

Debugging is set to use a random port that is available on the system. The port can be changed by setting the port option in the `serve` target in the project.json. Or by running the serve command with `--port <number>`.

For additional information on how to debug Node applications, see the [Node.js debugging getting started guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/#inspector-clients).
