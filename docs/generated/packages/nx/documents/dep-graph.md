# graph

Graph dependencies within workspace.

## Usage

```shell
nx graph
```

Install `nx` globally to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npx nx`, `yarn nx`, or `pnpm nx`.

### Examples

Open the project graph of the workspace in the browser:

```shell
 nx graph
```

Save the project graph into a json file:

```shell
 nx graph --file=output.json
```

Generate a static website with project graph into an html file, accompanied by an asset folder called static:

```shell
 nx graph --file=output.html
```

Print the project graph as JSON to the console:

```shell
 nx graph --print
```

Show the graph where every node is either an ancestor or a descendant of todos-feature-main:

```shell
 nx graph --focus=todos-feature-main
```

Include project-one and project-two in the project graph:

```shell
 nx graph --include=project-one,project-two
```

Exclude project-one and project-two from the project graph:

```shell
 nx graph --exclude=project-one,project-two
```

Show the graph where every node is either an ancestor or a descendant of todos-feature-main, but exclude project-one and project-two:

```shell
 nx graph --focus=todos-feature-main --exclude=project-one,project-two
```

Watch for changes to project graph and update in-browser:

```shell
 nx graph --watch
```
