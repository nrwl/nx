title: Workspace Plugin for Nx
description: Learn about the core workspace plugin that provides essential executors and generators for any Nx workspace, including tools for project management.
---

The workspace plugin contains executors and generators that are useful for any Nx workspace. It should be present in every Nx workspace and other plugins build on it.

## Creating Local Generators

Codifying your organization's best practices into local generators is a great way to ensure that the best practices are easy to follow and implement. Running `nx g @nx/plugin:plugin packages/feature` will create a local plugin with a generator which is written the same way generators are written for Nx plugins.

## Reorganizing Projects

After some time of working within a workspace, projects might need to be moved or sometimes even removed.
The workspace plugin provides the [`@nx/workspace:move`](/nx-api/workspace/generators/move) and [`@nx/workspace:remove`](/nx-api/workspace/generators/remove) generators to help aid with this.

### Moving Projects

Running `nx g @nx/workspace:move --projectName my-lib --destination new/location/my-lib` will move the `my-lib` library to `libs/new/location/my-lib`.

Moving the files manually can be done easily but a lot of steps are often missed when projects are moved. This generator will also handle the following:

1. The project's files will be moved
2. The project will be renamed to `new-location-my-lib`
3. The path mapping in `tsconfig.base.json` will be changed to `@npmScope/new/location/my-lib`
4. Imports in other projects will be changed to `@npmScope/new/location/my-lib`
5. Paths in target options such as output path will be changed
6. Other configuration will be updated too, such as `extends` in `tsconfig.json`, the name of the project in `jest.config.js`, and the extends in `.eslintrc.json`

### Removing Projects

Running `nx g @nx/workspace:remove my-lib` will remove the `my-lib` from the workspace. It is important to note that sometimes, projects cannot be removed if they are still depended on by other projects.

Like when moving projects, some steps are often missed when removing projects. This generator will also handle the following:

1. Checks if other projects depend on the project being removed. This can be ignored via the `--forceRemove` flag.
2. The project's files will be deleted.
3. The project's configuration will be removed.
4. The path mapping in `tsconfig.base.json` will be removed.
