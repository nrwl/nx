# Conformance Rule Examples

Here is a few examples creating various conformance rules. These examples demonstrate how to implement organizational standards and best practices across your workspace.

## Consistency Rules

Consistency rules ensure uniform patterns and standards across your codebase, making it easier for teams to stay uniform with your workspace standards.

## Maintainability Rules

Maintainability rules help ensure code remains easy to understand, modify, and extend over time.

## Reliability Rules

Reliability rules help prevent common issues and ensure robust, dependable code.

## Security Rules

Security rules help identify and prevent common security vulnerabilities and enforce security best practices.

It's very common to already have tool or scripts performing specific cations. For example, running cli tools for security scanning or compliance needs.

Because of the flexible APIs conformance provides, you're able to wrap these existing tools and provide reports based on their outcome.
This allows you to take Nx Cloud as the defacto dashboard for viewing the current state of your workspaces.
