# Continuous Integration with Nx

Implementing an efficient CI setup for monorepos - while crucial - can be challenging and maintenance heavy. That is [not your fault, though](/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud). Nx Cloud comes with a series of features that help make CI for monorepos faster, more reliable and more cost-effective.

## How Can Nx Improve Your CI Pipeline?

The benefits of Nx are not restricted to local development. Nx Cloud helps scale your project on CI by making it simple to create and maintain a pipeline that [eliminates wasted time](/ci/concepts/reduce-waste) and [efficiently parallelizes work](/ci/concepts/parallelization-distribution).

Your CI pipeline with Nx can:

- Run only tasks [affected](/ci/features/affected) by that PR
- [Share the task cache](/ci/features/remote-cache) to dramatically speed up your PRs (Nx Replay)
- [Distribute task execution](/ci/features/distribute-task-execution) across multiple agent machines (Nx Agents)
- Automatically [split long e2e tasks](/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks) into smaller tasks (Atomizer)
- Identify and Re-run [Flaky Tasks](/ci/features/flaky-tasks)

## Try Nx Cloud Yourself!
