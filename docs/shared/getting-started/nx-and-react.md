# Nx and React

Nx is a smart, fast and extensible build system with first class monorepo support and powerful integrations. It has a powerful core and a rich plugin ecosystem.

## Making Things Fast

If you're only interested in improving the performance of your monorepo by using Nx's [affected:\* commands](/using-nx/affected), [computation cache](/using-nx/cache), and [distributed task execution](/using-nx/dte), then you don't need to use any plugins. Everything will work the same way whether your monorepo has React, Vue, Svelte, or even Go, Rust, or Java apps. Nx is technology-agnostic.

Check out the following guides to get started:

- [Using Nx without plugins](/getting-started/nx-core)
- [Adding Nx to an existing monorepo](/migration/adding-to-monorepo)
- [Migrating from CRA](/migration/migration-cra)

It is also a good idea to read the [mental model guide](/using-nx/mental-model) to understand how Nx works.

## Nx and React Plugins

Nx plugins help you develop [React](/react/overview) applications with fully integrated support for modern tools
and libraries like [Jest](/jest/overview), [Cypress](/cypress/overview),
Storybook, [ESLint](/linter/eslint), and more. Nx also supports React
frameworks like [Next.js](/next/overview), Remix, and has great support for [React Native](/react-native/overview).
