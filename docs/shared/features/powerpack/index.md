# Powerpack Features

Nx PowerPack is a suite of paid extensions for the Nx CLI specifically designed for enterprises. Powerpack is available for Nx version 19.8 and higher.

The following features are available after you [activate a Powerpack license](/nx-enterprise/activate-powerpack):

{% cards cols="2" lgCols="3" mdCols="3" smCols="2" %}

    {% link-card title="Conformance" type="Powerpack Feature" url="/nx-enterprise/powerpack/conformance" icon="CheckBadgeIcon" /%}
    {% link-card title="Owners" type="Powerpack Feature"  url="/nx-enterprise/powerpack/owners" icon="UserGroupIcon" /%}

{% /cards %}

{% callout title="Looking for self-hosted caching?" type="info" %}

Self-hosted caching has previously been part of Powerpack, but no more. It is now free for everyone to use. [Learn more about our self-hosted caching options.](/recipes/running-tasks/self-hosted-caching)
