# Powerpack Free Licenses and Trials

## Free Licenses Enabling Self-Hosted Remote Cache

We value small teams using Nx. That's why we provide a free, remote cache-only license to any company with fewer than 30 engineers using Nx.

All licenses are perpetual, so you can use the latest version of Nx available to you while your license remains active, even after it expires.

We understand that some organizations may not neatly fit this definition (e.g., a larger organization with a small number of engineers using an Nx workspace). We'd like to unblock you. [Please reach out.](mailto:powerpack-support@nrwl.io)

## Extended Trial Periods

Nx Powerpack does not make any requests to external APIs, and activating Powerpack can be completed in just a few minutes. However, we understand that in many large organizations approval processes can take a long time. We're here to help you. Need a trial extension or help with your business case?
