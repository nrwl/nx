## Free Trial Licenses

You can get a free, 30-day license immediately if you want to try Nx Powerpack. We're here to support youâ€”whether that means extending your trial or helping with the installation. [Learn more about Nx Powerpack trials.](/assets/powerpack/NxPowerpack-Trial-v1.1.pdf)

If you're having trouble, [reach out for help.](mailto:powerpack-support@nrwl.io)

## Extended Trial Periods

Nx Powerpack does not make any requests to external APIs, and activating Powerpack can be completed in just a few minutes. However, we understand that in many large organizations, approval processes can take a long time. We're here to help you. Need a trial extension or help with your business case?

## Powerpack for OSS Projects

We offer free, full-featured Nx Powerpack licenses to open source projects. This happens through Nx Cloud (which is free for OSS projects). Just apply [here](/pricing#oss) and in the application form, make sure to confirm the Powerpack question.

If you're primarily looking for remote caching, then Nx Cloud is a great fit as it comes with a fully managed remote cache solution (among other CI features), free for OSS projects.
