# tasksRunnerOptions

As of Nx 20, the `tasksRunnerOptions` property in `nx.json` is deprecated. This property was used to register custom task runners. `tasksRunnerOptions` and custom task runners will cease to function in Nx 21. In Nx 20, the local cache metadata and project graph are stored in a database, rather than using the file system. (Cache artifacts are still stored on the file system.) This has two benefits:

1. Cache reads and writes are faster.
2. The local cache is more secure since other processes with access to the file system can no longer read or modify the cache.

For most organizations, this feature is a net positive. If you are currently using a custom task runner, you are most likely using it to define your own custom [remote cache](/ci/features/remote-cache) storage location. You have several options moving forward:

1. Use [Nx Cloud](/nx-cloud) for your remote cache
2. Use an [Nx Powerpack](/powerpack) plugin to store your remote cache on [Amazon S3](/nx-api/powerpack-s3-cache), [Google Cloud](/nx-api/powerpack-gcs-cache), [Google Cloud](/nx-api/powerpack-gcs-cache) or a [network drive](/nx-api/powerpack-shared-fs-cache)
3. Use the deprecated custom task runner feature until Nx 21
