# Environment Variables

The following environment variables are ones that you can set to change the behavior of Nx in different environments.

| Property                       | Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NX_ADD_PLUGINS                 | boolean        | If set to `false`, Nx will not add plugins to infer tasks. This is `true` by default. Workspaces created before Nx 18 will have this disabled via a migration for backwards compatibility                                      |
| NX_BASE                        | string         | The default base branch to use when calculating the affected projects. Can be overridden on the command line with `--base`.                                                                                                    |
| NX_CACHE_DIRECTORY             | string         | The cache for task outputs is stored in `.nx/cache` by default. Set this variable to use a different directory.                                                                                                                |
| NX_CACHE_PROJECT_GRAPH         | boolean        | If set to `false`, disables the project graph cache. Most useful when developing a plugin that modifies the project graph.                                                                                                     |
| NX_DAEMON                      | boolean        | If set to `false`, disables the Nx daemon process. Disable the daemon to print `console.log` statements in plugin code you are developing.                                                                                     |
| NX_DEFAULT_PROJECT             | string         | The default project used for commands which require a project. e.g. `nx build`, `nx g component`, etc.                                                                                                                         |
| NX_HEAD                        | string         | The default head branch to use when calculating the affected projects. Can be overridden on the command line with `--head`.                                                                                                    |
| NX_PERF_LOGGING                | boolean        | If set to `true`, will print debug information useful for profiling executors and Nx itself                                                                                                                                    |
| NX_PROFILE                     | string         | Prepend `NX_PROFILE=profile.json` before running targets with Nx to generate a file that be [loaded in Chrome dev tools](/troubleshooting/performance-profiling) to visualize the performance of Nx across multiple processes. |
| NX_WORKSPACE_DATA_DIRECTORY    | string         | The project graph cache and some other internal nx caches are stored in `.nx/workspace-data` by default. Set this variable to use a different directory.                                                                       |

| NX_TUI_AUTO_EXIT               | boolean/number | Controls whether the TUI automatically exits after tasks finish. If `true`, exits immediately. If `false`, never exits automatically. If a number, shows a countdown for that many seconds before exiting                      |

| NX_MAX_CACHE_SIZE              | string         | Alternative to configuring `maxCacheSize` in `nx.json`. Defines the maximum size of the local task cache. See [`maxCacheSize`](/reference/nx-json#max-cache-size) for supported units and behavior details.                    |
| NX_NATIVE_FILE_CACHE_DIRECTORY | string         | The cache for native `.node` files is stored under a global temp directory by default. Set this variable to use a different directory. This is interpreted as an absolute path.                                                |

Nx will set the following environment variables so they can be accessible within the process even outside of executors and generators.

| Property                     | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NX_TASK_TARGET_PROJECT       | string  | Set to the project name of the task being run. Use this to tell which project is being run.                                                               |
| NX_TASK_TARGET_TARGET        | string  | Set to the target name of the task being run. Use this to tell which target of the project is being run.                                                  |
| NX_TASK_TARGET_CONFIGURATION | string  | Set to the configuration name of the task being run. Use this to tell which configuration of the target is being run.                                     |
| NX_GRAPH_CREATION            | boolean | Set to `true` during the graph creation process. Use this to have inference plugins run different code during graph creation versus during task execution |
| NX_DRY_RUN                   | boolean | Set to `true` during dry runs of generators. Use this to avoid side effects during generators.                                                            |
| NX_INTERACTIVE               | boolean | Set to `false` when running generators with `--interactive=false`. Use this to prevent prompting during generators                                        |
