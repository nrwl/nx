# Distributed Task Execution at Scale

Repo contains:

- 5 shared buildable packages/libraries with 250 components each
- 5 Next.js applications built out of 20 app-specific libraries. Each app-specific lib has 250 components each. Each library uses the shared components.

The repo shows how Nx distributed task execution can make the CI 16 times faster with a small configuration change.
