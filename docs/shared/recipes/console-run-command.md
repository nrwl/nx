# Nx Console Run Command

The `Run` action allows you to choose an executor command and then opens a form listing out all the options for that executor. The frequently used executor commands `build`, `serve`, `test`, `e2e` and `lint` also have their own dedicated actions.

**From the Command Palette**

You can also construct the executor command options while staying entirely within the Command Palette. Use `⇧⌘P` to open the Command Palette, then select `nx: test`. After choosing a project, select any of the listed options to modify the executor command options. When you're satisfied with the constructed command, choose the `Execute` command at the top of the list.
