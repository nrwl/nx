# Nx Console Run Command

You can construct the executor command options while staying entirely within the Command Palette. Use `⇧⌘P` to open the Command Palette, then select `Nx: Run`. After choosing a project, select a target and any of the listed options to modify the executor command options. When you're satisfied with the constructed command, choose the `Execute` command at the top of the list.
You can also use `Nx: Run Target` to select a target first and then a matching project.
