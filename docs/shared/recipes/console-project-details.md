You can access the integrated Project Details View in multiple ways:

- By clicking on the Preview icon to the top right of your `project.json`, `package.json` or any file that modifies targets (for example `jest.config.ts` or `cypress.config.ts`)
- By using the codelenses in any of these files
- By running the `Nx: Open Project Details to Side` action while any file in a project is open
