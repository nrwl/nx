# Publish in CI/CD

Nx Release makes it easy to move your publishing process into your CI/CD pipeline.

## Automatically Skip Publishing Locally

When running `nx release`, after the version updates and changelog generation, you will be prompted with the following question:

```{% command="nx release" %}
...
? Do you want to publish these versions? (y/N) â€º
```

To move publishing into an automated pipeline, you will want to skip publishing when running `nx release` locally. To do this automatically, use the `--skip-publish` flag:

```{% command="nx release --skip-publish" %}
...

Skipped publishing packages.
```

## Use the Publish Subcommand

Nx Release provides a publishing subcommand that performs just the publishing step. Use this in your CI/CD pipeline to publish the packages.

```{% command="nx release publish" %}

## Publish in Github Actions

A common way to automate publishing packages is via Github Actions. An example of a publish workflow is as follows:

```yaml
# ./.github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v*.*.*

jobs:
  test:
    name: Publish
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write # needed for provenance data generation
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        shell: bash

      - name: Print Environment Info
        run: npx nx report
        shell: bash

      - name: Publish packages
        run: npx nx release publish
        shell: bash
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE: true
```

This workflow will install node, install npm dependencies, then run `nx release publish` to publish the packages. It will run on every push to the repository that creates a tag that matches the pattern `v*.*.*`. A release process using this workflow is as follows:

1. Run `nx release --skip-publish` locally. This will create a commit with the version and changelog updates, then create a tag for the new version.
2. Push the changes (including the new tag) to the remote repository with `git push && git push --tags`.
3. The publish workflow will automatically trigger and publish the packages to the npm registry.

## Configure the NODE_AUTH_TOKEN

The `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable is needed to authenticate with the npm registry. In the above workflow, it is passed into the Publish packages step via a [Github Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

### Generate a NODE_AUTH_TOKEN for NPM

To generate the correct `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` for the npmJS registry specifically, first login to [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/). Select your profile icon, then navigate to "Access Tokens". Generate a new Granular Access Token. Ensure that the token has read and write access to both the packages you are publishing and their organization (if applicable). Copy the generated token and add it as a secret to your Github repository.

### Add the NODE_AUTH_TOKEN to Github Secrets

To add the token as a secret to your Github repository, navigate to your repository, then select "Settings" > "Secrets and Variables" > "Actions". Add a new Repository Secret with the name `NPM_ACCESS_TOKEN` and the value of the token you generated in the previous step.

Note: The `NPM_ACCESS_TOKEN` name is not important other than that it matches the usage in the workflow:

```yaml
      - name: Publish packages
      run: npx nx release publish
      shell: bash
      env:
        NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE: true
```

[(See full workflow above)](#publish-in-github-actions)

## NPM Provenance

To verify your packages with [npm provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements), set the `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE` environment variable to `true` in the step where `nx release publish` is performed. The workflow will also need the `id-token: write` permission to generate the provenance data:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: Publish
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write # needed for provenance data generation
```

```yaml
- name: Publish packages
  run: npx nx release publish
  shell: bash
  env:
    NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE: true
```
