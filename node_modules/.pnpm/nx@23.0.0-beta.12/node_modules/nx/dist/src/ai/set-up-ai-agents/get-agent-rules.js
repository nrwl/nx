- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the \`nx-workspace\` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through \`nx\` (i.e. \`nx run\`, \`nx run-many\`, \`nx affected\`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., \`pnpm nx build\`, \`npm exec nx test\`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check \`node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md\`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or \`--help\` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the \`nx-generate\` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (\`nx g @nx/react:app\`), standard commands, things you already know
- The \`nx-generate\` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax
