AI agents are moving beyond autocomplete. They can now operate independently across projects. But most setups hit a wall: agents lack workspace context (seeing files, not architecture), generate inconsistent code, and have a hard time to interact with CI.

Nx monorepos solve this by enabling cross-project reasoning and by providing the structured metadata and CI integration that agents need to work autonomously:

- Deep **workspace architecture** understanding and project relationships
- **Code generators** for fast, predictable scaffolding
- **CI pipeline integration** to fix failures autonomously
- The ability to **iterate until CI is green** without human intervention

## Setup

To configure your Nx workspace for AI agents, run:

```shell
npx nx configure-ai-agents
```

This sets up:

- **Agent configuration files**: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` with workspace-specific guidelines
- **Agent skills**: Specialized capabilities for monorepo workflows, including CI monitoring and self-healing integration
- **Nx MCP server**: Provides tools that combine local workspace metadata with CI context, enabling seamless local-to-CI workflows that unlock true agent autonomy

## What This Enables

### Self-Healing CI Integration

Nx Cloud provides AI-powered [Self-Healing CI](/docs/features/ci-features/self-healing-ci) that analyzes failed runs and proposes verified fixes. With `configure-ai-agents`, your local agent connects to this CI counterpart via skills and the Nx MCP, gaining full context about run information, failures, and suggested fixes.

Your agent can autonomously iterate until CI passes:

```text
Commit this work, create a PR, and monitor CI until it's green.
```

The workflow:

1. Agent pushes changes and creates PR
2. Monitors CI pipeline
3. Receives failure context from Nx Cloud and Self-Healing CI
4. Accepts proposed fix or pulls context locally and manually applies it
5. Repeats until CI is green

This reduces context-switching—you review the final PR rather than intervening at each failure.

### Workspace Architecture Understanding

Nx exposes the project graph and relevant metadata to AI agents. This helps them move faster and more precisely:

- Identify all applications and libraries in the workspace
- Understand project relationships and dependencies
- Recognize project types and ownership via tags
- Determine which projects are affected by changes
- Suggest where to implement new functionality based on existing structure

This architectural awareness is critical for agents operating in large monorepos where understanding project relationships determines the quality of generated code.

### Predictable, Fast Code Generation

AI-generated code is token-intensive, slow, and not guaranteed to align with patterns in other projects. Nx generators solve this by providing predictable scaffolding that agents can invoke and then adapt.

Your AI agent can:

1. Find generators from [Nx plugins](/docs/plugin-registry) or custom [local workspace generators](/docs/extending-nx/local-generators)
2. Run the generator with correct options
3. Make small adjustments based on the specific situation

This approach is faster, produces consistent code across projects, and reduces hallucinations.
