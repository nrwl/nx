Any CI tool requires tight integration with your existing source control system. Nx Cloud offers first class integration with GitHub and GitLab in the following ways.

## Easy Workspace Setup

Get started quickly with Nx Cloud with our GitHub connection process. Connect your workspace by selecting your repo and organization from GitHub, and Nx Cloud will create a pull request with all the necessary configuration. User access is automatically connected to GitHub, and a PR is created to connect your workspace. Your repo now has [distributed caching](/docs/features/ci-features/remote-cache) in less than 5 minutes.

You can also create a new workspace from a template for experimentation. The new workspace will come pre-configured with Nx Cloud and examples of core Nx concepts. [Create a new Nx workspace](https://cloud.nx.app/create-nx-workspace) to get started.

[Connect your Nx Cloud account to GitHub](/docs/features/ci-features/github-integration#connect-to-github) to use this feature.

## Pull Request Insights

Good CI checks require fast and easy access to results. That's why Nx Cloud will update your PR with the current running status of your tasks and a convenient link to your Nx Cloud results and logs. Take advantage of the enhanced developer experience of structured and searchable logs. Quick insight to PR task progress, so you're not stuck waiting for every task to complete. And with Nx Replay, developers can quickly replay tasks locally to avoid running tasks that CI has already completed.

This feature is available in workspaces with the [Nx Cloud GitHub App installed](/docs/guides/nx-cloud/source-control-integration#install-the-app).

## Access Control

Nx Cloud organization access can be synced from a Github organization, so that memberships are automatically managed. This allows Nx Cloud to fit in to any existing on-boarding or off-boarding process. There's no need to manually manage users separately. Get your engineers Nx Cloud access right alongside their GitHub access so they can get to work fast. Use [personal access tokens](/docs/guides/nx-cloud/personal-access-tokens) to further enhance your security.

[Connect your Nx Cloud account to GitHub](/docs/features/ci-features/github-integration#connect-to-github) to use this feature. Members of your GitHub organization will also need to connect their GitHub accounts to access the organization.

## Connect to GitHub

Get started by connecting your Nx Cloud account to GitHub. This will allow you to access GitHub-powered organizations that you're a member of, easily connect workspaces, and configure automatic access control through GitHub.

{% call_to_action title="Connect to GitHub" url="https://cloud.nx.app/profile/vcs-integrations" icon="nxcloud" description="Connect your Nx Cloud account to GitHub in your profile settings" %}
Connect to GitHub
{% /call_to_action %}

Note that it doesn't matter what method you use to log into Nx Cloud, connecting your GitHub account is a separate step.

## Connect to GitHub during Initial Setup

1. Visit [Nx Cloud](https://cloud.nx.app) and click **Connect a workspace** at the top.
2. Select **Connect existing repository** from the dropdown.
3. Follow the prompts to select a repo.
4. If that repo is controlled by a GitHub organization, you will be prompted to use that organization.
5. Follow the prompts to create a pull request to complete your connection to Nx Cloud.

{% /call_to_action %}

## Connect an Organization to GitHub after Initial Setup

If you already have an organization in Nx Cloud, and you'd like to use your GitHub organization to manage access to it:

1. Go to the organization in Nx Cloud while logged in as an admin user.
2. Click on **Settings** in the top menu
3. Go to **Connect GitHub organization in the sidebar**
4. Follow the prompts there to connect to GitHub. Note that for every workspace in the Nx Cloud organization, there must be a corresponding repo in the GitHub organization.

## Connect a Workspace to GitHub after Initial Setup

If you already have a workspace connected to Nx Cloud, and you'd like to connect it to a GitHub repo to enable PR insights, [install the Nx Cloud GitHub App](/docs/guides/nx-cloud/source-control-integration).
