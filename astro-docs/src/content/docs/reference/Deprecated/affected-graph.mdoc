description: 'Graph dependencies affected by changes'

**Deprecated:** Use `nx graph --affected`, or `nx affected --graph` instead depending on which best suits your use case.
The `affected:graph` command was removed in Nx 19.

Graph dependencies affected by changes

## Usage

```shell
nx affected:graph
```

Install `nx` globally to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npx nx`, `yarn nx`, or `pnpm nx`.

### Examples

Open the project graph of the workspace in the browser, and highlight the projects affected by changing the index.ts
file:

```shell
 nx affected:graph --files=libs/mylib/src/index.ts
```

Open the project graph of the workspace in the browser, and highlight the projects affected by the changes between main
and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```shell
 nx affected:graph --base=main --head=HEAD
```

Save the project graph of the workspace in a json file, and highlight the projects affected by the changes between main
and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```shell
 nx affected:graph --base=main --head=HEAD --file=output.json
```

Generate a static website with project graph data in an html file, highlighting the projects affected by the changes
between main and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```shell
 nx affected:graph --base=main --head=HEAD --file=output.html
```

Open the project graph of the workspace in the browser, and highlight the projects affected by the last commit on main:

```shell
 nx affected:graph --base=main~1 --head=main
```

Open the project graph of the workspace in the browser, highlight the projects affected, but exclude project-one and
project-two:

```shell
 nx affected:graph --exclude=project-one,project-two
```
