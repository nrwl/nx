description: 'Prints information about the projects and targets affected by changes'

**Deprecated:** Use `nx show projects --affected`, `nx affected --graph -t build` or `nx graph --affected` depending on
which best suits your use case. The `print-affected` command was removed in Nx 19.

Prints information about the projects and targets affected by changes

## Usage

```shell
nx print-affected
```

Install `nx` globally to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npx nx`, `yarn nx`, or `pnpm nx`.

### Examples

Print information about affected projects and the project graph:

```shell
 nx print-affected
```

Print information about the projects affected by the changes between main and HEAD (e.g,. PR):

```shell
 nx print-affected --base=main --head=HEAD
```

Prints information about the affected projects and a list of tasks to test them:

```shell
 nx print-affected -t test
```

Prints the projects property from the print-affected output:

```shell
 nx print-affected -t build --select=projects
```

Prints the tasks.target.project property from the print-affected output:

```shell
 nx print-affected -t build --select=tasks.target.project
```
