This guide walks you through enabling AI features in Nx Cloud for both cloud-hosted and on-prem installations.

## Nx Cloud Hosted Setup

To enable AI features for your organization, go to [your organization's settings](https://cloud.nx.app/go/organization/edit) on Nx Cloud and select the organization where you want to enable AI.

In the **settings** menu, find the "AI Features" section and toggle it to "On".

![enable ai features](../../../../assets/features/ci-features/ai-features.avif)

Ensure that you **accept the AI terms** to start using the AI features.

AI features are available on Hobby, Team and Enterprise [Nx Cloud plans](https://nx.dev/pricing).

## Self-Healing CI for Enterprise On-Prem Installations

To enable Self-Healing CI for enterprise on-prem installations, follow these steps:

### Setup

Add the following configuration to your `helm-values.yaml` file:

```yaml
nxApi
  deployment:
    env:
      - name: NX_CLOUD_AI_ENABLED
        value: 'true'
      - name: NX_CLOUD_AI_TOKEN_PROVIDER_TYPE
        value: 'fixed'
      - name: NX_CLOUD_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
        value: 'sk-ant-...'

frontend
  deployment:
    env:
      - name: NX_CLOUD_AI_ENABLED
        value: 'true'
```

Then, enable AI features in the [organization settings](https://cloud.nx.app/go/organization/edit) and enable Self-Healing CI in the [workspace settings](https://cloud.nx.app/go/workspace/settings).

### Running Self-Healing CI On-Prem

#### Automatic DTE Agents

If using DTE agents, the self-healing CI step will be automatically added when the setting is enabled in the workspace settings.

#### Manual DTE

For manual DTE configurations, the `nx fix-ci` command must be included in the agent configuration after running nx tasks.

**Important:** This command must run **always**, meaning that even when previous nx tasks fail, the `fix-ci` command should still execute.

#### Non-DTE

For non-DTE setups, refer to the [Self-Healing CI documentation](/docs/features/ci-features/self-healing-ci) for detailed configuration instructions.

## Regional Availability

AI features are not available for the EU cluster in public cloud installations due to regional restrictions. However, on-prem customers in the EU can still use these features by providing their own Anthropic API key (for Self-Healing CI) and enabling the required environment variables.
