title: Skip Task Caching
description: Learn how to bypass Nx's caching mechanism for specific tasks, skip remote caching from Nx Cloud, and reset the cache when needed.

There are times when you might want to bypass the [caching mechanism](/features/cache-task-results), either locally or remotely.

## Skip Caching

To skip caching for a specific task, use the `--skip-nx-cache` flag. This can be useful when you want to ensure that a task runs fresh, without using cached results.

```shell {% frame="none" %}
npx nx build --skip-nx-cache
```

This will avoid using any local or remote cache.

## Skip Remote Caching from Nx Cloud

To skip remote caching provided by Nx Cloud, use the `--no-cloud` flag. This ensures that the task does not use cached results from Nx Cloud.

```shell {% frame="none" %}
npx nx build --no-cloud
```

It will **still use the local cache if available**.

## Reset

To clear the cache and metadata about the workspace and shuts down the Nx Daemon you can use the [reset](/reference/core-api/nx/documents/reset) command:

```shell {% frame="none" %}
npx nx reset
```
