# Nx Console Generate Command

The `Generate` action allows you to choose a generator and then opens a form listing out all the options for that generator. As you make changes to the form, the generator is executed in `--dry-run` mode in a terminal so you can preview the results of running the generator in real time.

**From the Command Palette**

You can also launch the `Generate` action from the Command Palette (`⇧⌘P`) by selecting `nx: generate (ui)`.

You can even construct the generator options while staying entirely within the Command Palette. Use `⇧⌘P` to open the Command Palette, then select `nx: generate`. After choosing a generator, select any of the listed options to modify the generator command. When you're satisfied with the constructed command, choose the `Execute` command at the top of the list.
