Nx Cloud AI offers a suite of features designed to **enhance your development workflow with AI-driven capabilities**. These tools assist in troubleshooting, optimizing resource allocation, and improving your overall development process.

- **[Self-Healing CI](/docs/features/ci-features/self-healing-ci)** - Have AI automatically analyze failed PR runs and propose fixes.
- **[Explain with AI](/docs/features/ci-features/explain-with-ai)** - Have AI provide detailed explanations and resolution steps for failed tasks.

## Enable Nx Cloud AI Features

To enable AI features for your organization, go to [your organization's settings](https://cloud.nx.app/go/organization/edit) on Nx Cloud and select the organization where you want to enable AI.

In the **settings** menu, find the "AI Features" section and toggle it to "On".

![enable ai features](../../../../assets/features/ci-features/ai-features.avif)

Ensure that you **accept the AI terms** to start using the AI features.

AI features are available on Hobby, Team and Enterprise [Nx Cloud plans](https://nx.dev/pricing).

## Explain with AI for Enterprise On-Prem Installations

To enable the Explain with AI feature for enterprise on-prem installations, add the following configuration to your `helm-values.yaml` file:

```yaml
nxApi
  deployment:
    env:
      - name: NX_CLOUD_AI_ENABLED
        value: 'true'

frontend
  deployment:
    env:
      - name: OPENAI_SECRET_KEY
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: open-ai-secrets
            key: OPENAI_SECRET_KEY
      - name: NX_CLOUD_AI_ENABLED
        value: 'true'
```

_(We use gpt-4o for the Explain with AI feature)_

Then, enable AI features in the [organization settings](https://cloud.nx.app/go/organization/edit).

## Self-Healing CI for Enterprise On-Prem Installations

To enable Self-Healing CI for enterprise on-prem installations, follow these steps:

### Setup

Add the following configuration to your `helm-values.yaml` file:

```yaml
nxApi
  deployment:
    env:
      - name: NX_CLOUD_AI_ENABLED
        value: 'true'
      - name: NX_CLOUD_AI_TOKEN_PROVIDER_TYPE
        value: 'fixed'
      - name: NX_CLOUD_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
        value: 'sk-ant-...'

frontend
  deployment:
    env:
      - name: NX_CLOUD_AI_ENABLED
        value: 'true'
```

Then, enable AI features in the [organization settings](https://cloud.nx.app/go/organization/edit) and enable Self-Healing CI in the [workspace settings](https://cloud.nx.app/go/workspace/settings).

### Running Self-Healing CI

#### Automatic DTE Agents

If using DTE agents, the self-healing CI step will be automatically added when the setting is enabled in the workspace settings.

#### Manual DTE

For manual DTE configurations, the `nx fix-ci` command must be included in the agent configuration after running nx tasks.

**Important:** This command must run **always**, meaning that even when previous nx tasks fail, the `fix-ci` command should still execute.

#### Non-DTE

For non-DTE setups, refer to the [Self-Healing CI documentation](/docs/features/ci-features/self-healing-ci) for detailed configuration instructions.

## Regional Availability

AI features are not available for the EU cluster in public cloud installations due to regional restrictions. However, on-prem customers in the EU can still use these features by providing their own OpenAI secret key (for Explain with AI) or Anthropic API key (for Self-Healing CI) and enabling the required environment variables.
