[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a mature, minimal, and an open source web framework for making web applications and
apis.

## Create a New Workspace

To create a new workspace with a pre-created Express app, run the following command:

```shell {% frame="none" %}
 npx create-nx-workspace --preset=express
```

## Setting Up @nx/express

### Installation

{% aside type="note" title="Keep Nx Package Versions In Sync" %}
Make sure to install the `@nx/express` version that matches the version of `nx` in your repository. If the version numbers get out of sync, you can encounter some difficult to debug errors. You can [fix Nx version mismatches with this recipe](/docs/guides/tips-n-tricks/keep-nx-versions-in-sync).
{% /aside %}

In any Nx workspace, you can install `@nx/express` by running the following command:

```shell {% frame="none" %}
nx add @nx/express
```

This will install the correct version of `@nx/express`.
