Storybook allows you to customize the `webpack` configuration and your `vite` configuration. For that, it offers two fields you can add in your `.storybook/main.js|ts` file, called `webpackFinal` and `viteFinal`. These fields are functions that take the default configuration as an argument, and return the modified configuration. You can read more about them in the [Storybook documentation for `webpack`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/builders/webpack#extending-storybooks-webpack-config) and the [Storybook documentation for `vite`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/builders/vite#configuration).

You can use these fields in your Nx workspace Storybook configurations normally, following the Storybook docs. However, let's see how you can create a global configuration for every project in your workspace, and how you can override it for specific projects.

## Global configuration

If you want to add a global configuration for Webpack or Vite in your workspace, you may create a `.storybook/main.js` file at the root of your workspace. In that root `.storybook/main.js|ts` file, you can add the `webpackFinal` or `viteFinal` field, and return the modified configuration. This will be applied to every project in your workspace.

### `webpack` and `webpackFinal`

The `webpackFinal` field would look like this:

```ts frame="none"
// .storybook/main.ts
webpackFinal: async (config, { configType }) => {
  // Make whatever fine-grained changes you need that should apply to all storybook configs

  // Return the altered config
  return config;
},
```

### `vite` and `viteFinal`

The `viteFinal` field would look like this:

```ts frame="none"
// .storybook/main.ts
async viteFinal(config, { configType }) {
   if (configType === 'DEVELOPMENT') {
     // Your development configuration goes here
   }
   if (configType === 'PRODUCTION') {
     // Your production configuration goes here.
   }
   return mergeConfig(config, {
     // Your environment configuration here
   });
 },
```

In the `viteFinal` case, you would have to import the `mergeConfig` function from `vite`. So, on the top of your root `.storybook/main.js|ts` file, you would have to add:

```ts frame="none"
// .storybook/main.ts
import { mergeConfig } from 'vite';
```

## Project-specific configuration

### `webpack` and `webpackFinal`

You can customize the `webpack` configuration for a specific project by adding a `webpackFinal` field in your project-specific `.storybook/main.js|ts` file, like this:

```ts frame="none"
// apps/my-react-webpack-app/.storybook/main.ts
import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/react-webpack5';

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  stories: ...,
  addons: ...,
  framework: {
    name: '@storybook/react-webpack5',
    options: {},
  },
  webpackFinal: async (config, { configType }) => {
    // add your own webpack tweaks if needed
    return config;
  },
};

export default config;
```

If you are using a global, root-level, `webpack` configuration in your project, you can customize or extend that for a specific project by importing and extending the root configuration.

### `vite` and `viteFinal`

You can customize the `vite` configuration for a specific project by adding a `viteFinal` field in your project-specific `.storybook/main.js|ts` file, following the same pattern as shown above for webpack configuration.
