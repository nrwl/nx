This guide extends the
[Using Storybook in a Nx workspace - Best practices](/technologies/test-tools/storybook/guides/best-practices) guide. In that guide, we discussed the best practices of using Storybook in a Nx workspace. We explained the main concepts and the mental model of how to best set up Storybook. In this guide, we are going to see how to put that into practice, by looking at a real-world example. We are going to see how you can publish one single Storybook for your workspace, even you are using multiple frameworks, taking advantage of [Storybook Composition](/technologies/test-tools/storybook/guides/storybook-composition-setup).

In this case, we are dealing with a Nx workspace that uses multiple frameworks. Essentially, you would need to have one Storybook host for each of the frameworks, containing all the stories of that specific framework, since the Storybook builder can not handle multiple frameworks simultaneously.

However, there is still the option to combine all the hosts into one single Storybook instance, using _Storybook composition_.

Let's assume that you have a structure like the one described in the previous example, and your `client` app and the `client` libs are written in Angular, and the `admin` app the `admin` libs are written in React.

First of all, you have to create two Storybook host apps, one for Angular and one for React. Let's call them `storybook-host-angular` and `storybook-host-react`, which are configured to import all the Angular stories and all the React stories accordingly.

Now, we are going to combine the two Storybook host apps into one, using Storybook composition. You can read our [Storybook Composition guide](/technologies/test-tools/storybook/guides/storybook-composition-setup) for a detailed explanation for how Storybook Composition works. In a nutshell, you can have one "host" Storybook instance running, where you can link other running Storybook instances.

## Steps

We are going to assume that you are at the state where you already have your `storybook-host-angular` and `storybook-host-react` set up and ready to go.

### Generate a Storybook host library

It does not matter which framework you use for the host Storybook library. It can be any framework really, and it does not have to be one of the frameworks that are used in the hosted apps. The only thing that is important is for this host library to have _at least one story_. This is important, or else Storybook will not load. The one story can be a component, for example, which would work like a title for the application, or any other introduction to your Storybook you see fit.

So, let's use React for the Storybook Composition host library:

```shell {% frame="none" %}
nx g @nx/react:lib libs/storybook-host --bundler=none --unitTestRunner=none
```

Now that your library is generated, you can write your intro in the generated component (you can also do this later, it does not matter).

### Generate Storybook configuration for the host library

Since you do need a story for your host Storybook, you should use the React storybook configuration generator, and actually choose to generate stories (not an e2e project though):

```shell {% frame="none" %}
nx g @nx/react:storybook-configuration storybook-host --interactionTests=true --generateStories=true
```

### Change the Storybook port in the hosted apps

It's important to change the Storybook ports in the `storybook-host-angular` and `storybook-host-react` projects. This is because the Storybook Composition host is going to be looking at these ports to find which Storybooks to host, and which Storybook goes where.

Update the `project.json` file of each library to set the `port` option to `4401` and `4402` accordingly:

```json {% meta="{8}" %}
// libs/storybook-host-angular/project.json
{
  // ...
  "targets": {
    // ...
    "storybook": {
      "options": {
        "port": 4401
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json {% meta="{8}" %}
// libs/storybook-host-react/project.json
{
  // ...
  "targets": {
    // ...
    "storybook": {
      "options": {
        "port": 4402
      }
    }
  }
}
```

{% aside type="note" title="Inferred tasks vs explicit tasks" %}
Projects using [inferred tasks](/concepts/inferred-tasks) might not have the `storybook` target defined in the `project.json` file, so you need to add the target with only the `port` option set.

If the project has the `storybook` target explicitly defined in the `project.json` file, you need to update or set the `port` option.
{% /aside %}

### Add the `refs` to the main.ts of the host library

Update the `libs/storybook-host/.storybook/main.ts` file as shown below:

```javascript {% meta="{14-23}" %}
// libs/storybook-host/.storybook/main.ts
import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/react-vite';
import { nxViteTsPaths } from '@nx/vite/plugins/nx-tsconfig-paths.plugin';
import { mergeConfig } from 'vite';

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  stories: ['../src/lib/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx|mdx)'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-essentials', '@storybook/addon-interactions'],
  framework: {
    name: '@storybook/react-vite',
    options: {},
  },

  refs: {
    'my-angular-app': {
      title: 'My Angular App',
      url: 'http://localhost:4401',
    },
    'my-react-app': {
      title: 'My React App',
      url: 'http://localhost:4402',
    },
  },

  viteFinal: async (config) =>
    mergeConfig(config, {
      plugins: [nxViteTsPaths()],
    }),
};

export default config;
```

## Serve the Storybooks

Now, you can serve your host Storybook, as well as the hosted, composed Storybooks. You need to serve the composed Storybooks first, and then your host.

```shell {% frame="none" %}
nx run storybook-host-angular:storybook
```

and on a different terminal:

```shell {% frame="none" %}
nx run storybook-host-react:storybook
```

and then on a different terminal serve the host:

```shell {% frame="none" %}
nx run storybook-host:storybook
```

You should now be able to see your host Storybook on your default port (usually `4400`) and you should also be able to see your composed Storybooks in the sidebar.

## Build and deploy

You can now build and deploy the Storybook host.

You can build the Storybook with:

```shell {% frame="none" %}
nx run storybook-host:build-storybook
```

Here's the catch. You will need to build and deploy the composed Storybooks independently as well, and make sure that they are available on the URLs that you have configured in your host Storybook's `main.ts`. In our example above, the host Storybook would be looking for the composed Storybooks on `http://localhost:4401` and `http://localhost:4402`. So you need to build and deploy:

- `storybook-host-angular` on some URL, let's say https://my-angular-stories.my-company.com/
- `storybook-host-react` on some URL, let's say https://my-react-stories.my-company.com/

and then change the host Storybook's `main.ts` file to point to these URLs accordingly:

```javascript
// libs/storybook-host/.storybook/main.ts
import type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/react-vite';
import { nxViteTsPaths } from '@nx/vite/plugins/nx-tsconfig-paths.plugin';
import { mergeConfig } from 'vite';

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  stories: ['../src/lib/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx|mdx)'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-essentials', '@storybook/addon-interactions'],
  framework: {
    name: '@storybook/react-vite',
    options: {},
  },

  refs: {
    'my-angular-app': {
      title: 'My Angular App',
      url: 'https://my-angular-stories.my-company.com/',
    },
    'my-react-app': {
      title: 'My React App',
      url: 'https://my-react-stories.my-company.com/',
    },
  },

  viteFinal: async (config) =>
    mergeConfig(config, {
      plugins: [nxViteTsPaths()],
    }),
};

export default config;
```

As you can see, the Storybook Composition solution would work for a small number of composed apps, but it can become quite cumbersome to manage if you have too many apps that you want to compose into your host Storybook.

## Use cases that apply to this solution

- Workspaces using multiple frameworks
- Workspaces that have multiple Storybooks that they want to view in one single interface
- Workspaces that use component libraries in multiple frameworks and want to showcase all their components in one single Storybook instance
