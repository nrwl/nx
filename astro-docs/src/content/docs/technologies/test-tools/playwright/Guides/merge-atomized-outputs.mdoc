When running Playwright tests in CI environments, Nx can [split tests across multiple parallel tasks](/docs/features/ci-features/split-e2e-tasks) for faster execution.
However, this creates separate test reports for each task.
With the Nx Plugin, the Playwright report merging feature allows you to combine these individual reports into a single, unified report.

**Benefits:**

- View all test results in one consolidated report
- Maintain the same reporting experience as non-atomized tests
- Keep the performance benefits of parallel test execution

## Prerequisites

- Nx workspace with `@nx/playwright` plugin
- Playwright tests configured in your project
- CI environment with [task atomization enabled](/docs/features/ci-features/split-e2e-tasks)
- Nx v21.6.1

{% aside type="note" title="Nx Version"%}
Nx v21.6.1 introduced automatic configuration of report merging which is the focus of this guide.
Similar steps can be followed for manual configuration of Playwright for any versions prior to Nx v21.6.1

## How report merging works

1. **Blob Reports**: Playwright generates [lightweight "blob" reports](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#blob-reporter) during test execution
2. **Individual Tasks**: Each atomized test task creates its own blob report
3. **Report Merging**: A separate merge task combines all blob reports into unified output using your configured reporters (HTML, JSON, JUnit, etc.)

## Configuration

### Step 1: Enable blob reports

The `nxE2EPreset` from `@nx/playwright/preset` automatically enable the blob reporter when running in CI:

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { nxE2EPreset } from '@nx/playwright/preset';

export default defineConfig({
  // automatically uses the blob reporter for CI
  ...nxE2EPreset(__filename, { testDir: './src' }),
  // Your additional configuration
});
```

> The preset has a `generateBlobReports` option that can be used to disable the reporter or maybe enable it not just in CI.

**Alternative manual configuration:**

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],
    // NOTE: depending on your TS config, you might need to use `as const` to prevent type errors
    ...(process.env.CI
      ? [['blob', { outputDir: 'blob-report' }] as const]
      : []),
  ],
  // Your other configuration
});
```

### Step 2: Configure the Playwright plugin

Add a `ciTargetName` to the Playwright plugin to your `nx.json`. This will enable task splitting and report merging features for CI environments:

```json
// nx.json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "plugin": "@nx/playwright/plugin",
      "options": {
        "targetName": "e2e",
        "ciTargetName": "e2e-ci"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

With the above configurations, Nx automatically creates these targets for your Playwright projects:

- `e2e`: Regular target for local development (runs all tests together)
- `e2e-ci`: CI target that runs tests in parallel across multiple tasks
- `e2e-ci--merge-reports`: Target that merges blob reports into unified reports

## Running the feature

**Local Development:**

```shell {% frame="none" %}
# Run tests normally (no blob reports generated)
nx run my-app:e2e
```

**CI Environment:**

```shell {% frame="none" %}
# Run atomized tests (generates blob reports)
nx run my-app:e2e-ci

# Merge the reports
nx run my-app:e2e-ci--merge-reports
```

## Complete example

Here's a complete working example for reference:

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { nxE2EPreset } from '@nx/playwright/preset';

export default defineConfig({
  ...nxE2EPreset(__filename, { testDir: './e2e' }),
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:4200',
  },
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    port: 4200,
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

```json
// nx.json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "plugin": "@nx/playwright/plugin",
      "options": {
        "targetName": "e2e",
        "ciTargetName": "e2e-ci"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## CI Integration

> The following example CI configuration is for GitHub Actions, but the same steps can be followed in all CI providers.
> The most important part is to always call the merge report target, `e2e-ci--merge-reports`, even if the E2E tests fail to always have a final merged report.

```yaml
// .github/workflows/ci.yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  main:
    steps:
      ...
      - name: Run E2E Tests
        run: nx run my-app:e2e-ci

      - name: Merge Test Reports
        run: nx run my-app:e2e-ci--merge-reports
        # Run even if tests fail to get partial results
        if: always()
```

## Troubleshooting

### "The blob reporter is not configured"

**Problem:** The merge task warns that no blob reporter is configured.

**Solution:** Ensure the blob reporter is added to your Playwright configuration:

- If overriding the `reporter` in the Playwright configuration, make sure to add the blob reporter:

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    // existing reporters
    ...(process.env.CI ? [['blob', { outputDir: 'blob-report' }]] : []),
  ],
  // Your other configuration
});
```

### Missing test results in report

**Problem:** The merge shows fewer results than expected test suites.

**Solution:**

- Check if some test tasks failed or were cancelled
- Verify all blob report files are present in the blob report directory
- Review CI logs for any task failures

### Reports not merging

**Problem:** Individual blob reports exist but aren't being merged.

**Solution:**

- Ensure the merge target is running after all test tasks complete
  - The default merge target name is `e2e-ci--merge-reports`
  - You can run `nx show project <e2e-project-name>` to view targets available on your project to verify the target exists
- Check that the blob report directory path is correct
- Verify Playwright CLI is available in the CI environment

### [WARNING] "No additional reporters are configured"

**Problem:** Only the blob reporter is configured, so it will be the only report produced

**Solution:** Add at least one additional reporter (HTML, JSON, JUnit, etc.) alongside the blob reporter.

List of available Playwright reports can be found in the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters).

## Best Practices

1. **Environment-based Configuration**: Only enable blob reports in CI to avoid overhead during local development
2. **Error Handling**: Use `if: always()` (or similar) in CI workflows to merge partial results even when some tests fail
3. **Output Artifacts**: Archive both blob reports and merged reports as CI artifacts for debugging
4. **Validation**: The merge task automatically validates the expected number of test results
