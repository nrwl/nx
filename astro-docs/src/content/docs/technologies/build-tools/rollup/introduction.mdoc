The Nx Plugin for Rollup contains executors and generators that support building applications using Rollup.

## Setting Up @nx/rollup

### Installation

{% aside type="note" title="Keep Nx Package Versions In Sync" %}
Make sure to install the `@nx/rollup` version that matches the version of `nx` in your repository. If the version numbers get out of sync, you can encounter some difficult to debug errors. You can [fix Nx version mismatches with this recipe](/recipes/tips-n-tricks/keep-nx-versions-in-sync).
{% /aside %}

In any Nx workspace, you can install `@nx/rollup` by running the following command:

```shell frame="none"
nx add @nx/rollup
```

This will install the correct version of `@nx/rollup`.

## Using @nx/rollup

### Generate a new project using Rollup

You can generate a new library that uses Rollup with the following command:

```bash frame="none"
nx g @nx/js:lib mylib --bundler=rollup
```

This will create a new library configured to use Rollup for building.
