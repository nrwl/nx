This guide will walk you through creating a Module Federated setup with Server Side Rendering (SSR) for Angular and React using Nx and its generators.

## Steps

### Create an empty workspace

Run the following command with the options listed to create an empty workspace.

```shell frame="terminal" title="npx create-nx-workspace@latest myorg --preset=apps"
// filename: ~

### Install your framework plugin

{% aside type="note" title="Keep Nx Package Versions In Sync" %}
Make sure to install the `@nx/angular` or `@nx/react` versions that matches the version of `nx` in your repository. If the version numbers get out of sync, you can encounter some difficult to debug errors. You can [fix Nx version mismatches with this recipe](/docs/guides/tips-n-tricks/keep-nx-versions-in-sync).
{% /aside %}

{% tabs %}

{% tabitem label="Angular" %}

```shell frame="terminal" title="nx add @nx/angular"
// filename: ~/myorg

```

{% /tabitem %}

{% tabitem label="React" %}

```shell frame="terminal" title="nx add @nx/react"
// filename: ~/myorg

```

{% /tabitem %}

{% /tabs %}

### Generating a host and multiple remotes with SSR

We will generate the apps required for a storefront application.  
We will need the following applications:

- Store - _host application_
- Product - _remote application_
- Checkout - _remote application_

Nx allows you to do this with a single command:

{% tabs %}

{% tabitem label="Angular" %}

```shell frame="terminal" title="npx nx g @nx/angular:host apps/store --ssr --remotes=product,checkout"
// filename: ~/myorg

```

{% /tabitem %}

{% tabitem label="React" %}

```shell frame="terminal" title="npx nx g @nx/react:host apps/store --ssr --remotes=product,checkout"
// filename: ~/myorg

```

{% /tabitem %}

{% /tabs %}

This will generate three applications, set up with SSR and Module Federation.

### Serving the store application

When using Module Federation, we want to serve the host application along with the remote applications so that everything works as expected.

To do this, run:

{% tabs %}

{% tabitem label="Angular" %}

```shell frame="terminal" title="npx nx serve-ssr store"
// filename: ~/myorg

```

{% /tabitem %}

{% tabitem label="React" %}

```shell frame="terminal" title="npx nx serve store"
// filename: ~/myorg

```

{% /tabitem %}

{% /tabs %}

This will run all three application servers but only the `store` will be watching for file changes. If you make a change to one of the remote applications (`checkout` or `product`) the changes will not be hot reloaded.

### Serving the store application with file watching for checkout

If working on a remote application, we can still serve it via the host application and have it watch for changes.

To serve the `store` application and watch for changes on the `checkout` application run:

{% tabs %}

{% tabitem label="Angular" %}

```shell frame="terminal" title="npx nx serve-ssr store --devRemotes=checkout"
// filename: ~/myorg

```

{% /tabitem %}

{% tabitem label="React" %}

```shell frame="terminal" title="npx nx serve store --devRemotes=checkout"
// filename: ~/myorg

```

{% /tabitem %}

{% /tabs %}
