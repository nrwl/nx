Nx collects usage data to help improve the developer experience. Telemetry is completely optional and can be disabled at any time.

## Why Nx collects telemetry

Telemetry helps the Nx team understand how Nx is used in practice. This data guides decisions about which features to prioritize, identifies common issues, and helps improve performance. No project-specific or personally identifiable information is collected.

## What is collected

Nx collects general usage data in the following categories:

- **Command usage**: which Nx commands are run (e.g., `build`, `test`, `generate`), how long they take, and how many tasks were executed or cached.
- **Environment info**: operating system, CPU architecture, Node.js version, package manager and version, Nx version, and whether the command runs in CI.
- **General configuration**: whether [Nx Cloud](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud) is connected.

## What about sensitive data?

Nx does **not** collect any metrics that may contain sensitive data.
This includes, but is not limited to: environment variables, personally identifiable information, file paths, contents of files, logs, or git remote information.

For more information, see the [privacy policy](https://cloud.nx.app/privacy).

## How to opt out

When you first run an Nx command in an interactive terminal, Nx asks whether you'd like to share usage data.
If you decline, telemetry is disabled for that workspace.

You can also disable telemetry at any time by setting `analytics` to `false` in your `nx.json`:

```json
// nx.json
{
  "analytics": false
}
```

In CI environments, Nx does not prompt for telemetry. Telemetry only runs in CI if `analytics` is explicitly set to `true` in `nx.json`.

## How to re-enable

To re-enable telemetry, set `analytics` to `true` in your `nx.json`:

```json
// nx.json
{
  "analytics": true
}
```

## Nx Console telemetry

The Nx Console editor extensions (VS Code and JetBrains) collect their own telemetry, separate from the Nx CLI.
