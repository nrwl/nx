## Visualize your Project Structure

Nx automatically detects the dependencies between the various parts of your workspace and builds a [project graph](/features/explore-graph). This graph is used by Nx to perform various optimizations such as determining the correct order of execution when running tasks like `nx build`, identifying [affected projects](/features/run-tasks#run-tasks-on-projects-affected-by-a-pr) and more. Interestingly you can also visualize it.

Just run:

```shell
nx graph
```

Notice how `ui` is not yet connected to anything because we didn't import it in any of our projects.

Exercise for you: change the codebase such that `ui` is used by `orders` and `products`. Note: you need to restart the `nx graph` command to update the graph visualization.
