## Test Affected Projects

One of the key features of Nx in a monorepo setting is that you're able to run tasks only for projects that are actually affected by the code changes that you've made. This feature relies on `git` to determine which files have been changed.

If we were developing locally, you could commit your changes so far and then make a small change to the `products` library.

```tsx title="libs/products/src/lib/products.tsx"
import styles from './products.module.css';

export function Products() {
  return (
    <div className={styles['container']}>
      <h1>Welcome to Products!</h1>
      <p>This is a change. ðŸ‘‹</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Products;
```

Then the following command would run the tests for only the projects affected by this change:

```shell
# This does not work in the browser webcontainer
npx nx affected -t test
```

:::info
This webcontainer does not have `git` enabled, so we have to manually tell Nx which files were touched.
:::

Use this command in the webcontainer terminal to manually specify which files have been touched.

```shell
npx nx affected -t test --files=libs/products/src/lib/products.tsx
```

Note that the unit tests were run for `products`, `react-store` and `inventory`, but not for `orders` because a change to `products` can not possibly break the tests for `orders`. In a small repo like this, there isn't a lot of time saved, but as there are more tests and more projects, this quickly becomes an essential command.

You can also see what projects are affected in the graph visualizer with;

```shell
npx nx graph --affected --files=libs/products/src/lib/products.tsx
```

## Build the Apps for Deployment

{/* <VideoLink link="https://youtu.be/gc4N7kxiA50?t=713"></VideoLink> */}

If you're ready and want to ship your applications, you can build them using

```shell
npx nx run-many -t build
```

All the required files will be placed in `/apps/react-store/dist` and `/apps/inventory/dist` and can be deployed to your favorite hosting provider.

Nx will run any script defined in `package.json`, so you can create a `deploy` task that sends the build output to your hosting provider.

```json {% fileName="apps/react-store/package.json" %}
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "netlify deploy --dir=dist"
}
```

We want to let Nx know that the `build` task needs to be run before the `deploy` task, so we add a `dependsOn` property for that target.

```json title="apps/react-store/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "netlify deploy --dir=dist"
  },
  "nx": {
    "targets": {
      "deploy": {
        "dependsOn": ["build"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to keep the script next to its Nx configuration, you can rewrite the above configuration like this:

```json title="apps/react-store/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {},
  "nx": {
    "targets": {
      "deploy": {
        "command": "netlify deploy --dir=dist",
        "dependsOn": ["build"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the `deploy` script with whatever terminal command you use to deploy your site.

The `"dependsOn": ["build"]` setting tells Nx to make sure that the project's `build` task has been run successfully before the `deploy` task.

With the `deploy` tasks defined, you can deploy a single application with `npx nx deploy react-store` or deploy any applications affected by the current changes with:

```shell
npx nx affected -t deploy
```
