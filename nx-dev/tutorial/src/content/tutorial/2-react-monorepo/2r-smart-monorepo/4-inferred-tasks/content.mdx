## Inferred Tasks

Nx identifies available tasks for your project from [tooling configuration files](/concepts/inferred-tasks), `package.json` scripts and the targets defined in `project.json`. To view the tasks that Nx has detected, look in the [Nx Console](/getting-started/editor-setup) project detail view or run:

```shell
npx nx show project @react-monorepo/react-store
```

If you expand the `build` task, you can see that it was created by the `@nx/vite` plugin by analyzing your `vite.config.ts` file. Notice the outputs are defined as `{projectRoot}/dist`. This value is being read from the `build.outDir` defined in your `vite.config.ts` file. Let's change that value in your `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts title="apps/react-store/vite.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  build: {
    outDir: './build',
    // ...
  },
});
```

Now if you close and reopen the project details view, the outputs for the build target will say `{projectRoot}/build`. This feature ensures that Nx will always cache the correct files.

You can also override the settings for inferred tasks by modifying the [`targetDefaults` in `nx.json`](/reference/nx-json#target-defaults) or setting a value in your [`package.json` file](/reference/project-configuration). Nx will merge the values from the inferred tasks with the values you define in `targetDefaults` and in your specific project's configuration.

Set the `outDir` back to `./dist` so that we don't have to modify all the other tools to account for a different build output folder.

```ts title="apps/react-store/vite.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  build: {
    outDir: './dist',
    // ...
  },
});
```
