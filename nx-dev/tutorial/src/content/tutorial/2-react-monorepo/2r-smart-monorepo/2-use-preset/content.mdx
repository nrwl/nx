## Creating a new React Monorepo

import { VideoLink } from '@nx/nx-dev/ui-markdoc';

Create a new React monorepo with the following command:

```shell
npx create-nx-workspace@latest react-monorepo --preset=react-monorepo
```

```
NX   Let's create a new workspace [https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro]

✔ Application name · react-store
✔ Which bundler would you like to use? · vite
✔ Test runner to use for end to end (E2E) tests · cypress
✔ Default stylesheet format · css
✔ Which CI provider would you like to use? · GitHub Actions
```

Let's name the initial application `react-store`. In this tutorial we're going to use `vite` as a bundler, `cypress` for e2e tests and `css` for styling. We'll talk more about how Nx integrates with GitHub Actions later in the tutorial. The above command generates the following structure:

```
└─ react-monorepo
   ├─ ...
   ├─ apps
   │  ├─ react-store
   │  │  ├─ public
   │  │  │  └─ ...
   │  │  ├─ src
   │  │  │  ├─ app
   │  │  │  │  ├─ app.module.css
   │  │  │  │  ├─ app.spec.tsx
   │  │  │  │  ├─ app.tsx
   │  │  │  │  └─ nx-welcome.tsx
   │  │  │  ├─ assets
   │  │  │  ├─ main.tsx
   │  │  │  └─ styles.css
   │  │  ├─ index.html
   │  │  ├─ project.json
   │  │  ├─ tsconfig.app.json
   │  │  ├─ tsconfig.json
   │  │  ├─ tsconfig.spec.json
   │  │  └─ vite.config.ts
   │  └─ react-store-e2e
   │     └─ ...
   ├─ nx.json
   ├─ tsconfig.base.json
   └─ package.json
```

The setup includes..

- a new React application (`apps/react-store/`)
- a Playwright based set of e2e tests (`apps/react-store-e2e/`)
- Prettier preconfigured
- ESLint preconfigured
- Jest preconfigured

One way to structure an Nx monorepo is to place application projects in the `apps` folder and library projects in the `libs` folder. Applications are encouraged to be as light-weight as possible so that more code is pushed into libraries and can be reused in other projects. This folder structure is just a suggestion and can be modified to suit your organization's needs.

The [`nx.json` file](/reference/nx-json) contains configuration settings for Nx itself and global default settings that individual projects inherit. The `apps/react-store/project.json` file contains [settings that are specific to the `react-store` project](/reference/project-configuration). We'll examine that file more in the next section.
