## Open a Pull Request

Commit the changes and open a new PR on GitHub.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m 'add CI workflow file'
git push origin add-workflow
```

When you view the PR on GitHub, you will see a comment from Nx Cloud that reports on the status of the CI run.

![Nx Cloud report](/tutorials/images/github-pr-cloud-report.avif)

The `See all runs` link goes to a page with the progress and results of tasks that were run in the CI pipeline.
