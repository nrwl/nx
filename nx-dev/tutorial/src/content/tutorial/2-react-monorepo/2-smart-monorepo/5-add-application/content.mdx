Nx plugins usually provide [generators](/features/generate-code) that allow you to easily scaffold code, configuration or entire projects. To see what capabilities the `@nx/react` plugin provides, run the following command and inspect the output:

```shell
npx nx list @nx/react
```

#### Prefer a more visual UI?

If you prefer a more integrated experience, you can install the "Nx Console" extension for your code editor. It has support for VSCode, IntelliJ and ships a LSP for Vim. Nx Console provides autocompletion support in Nx configuration files and has UIs for browsing and running generators.

More info can be found in [the integrate with editors article](/getting-started/editor-setup).

Run the following command to generate a new `inventory` application. Note how we append `--dry-run` to first check the output.

```shell
npx nx g @nx/react:app apps/inventory --dry-run
```

```
NX  Generating @nx/react:application

✔ Would you like to add React Router to this application? (y/N) · false
✔ What unit test runner should be used? · vitest
✔ Which E2E test runner would you like to use? · cypress
```

As you can see, it generates a new application in the `apps/inventory/` folder. Let's actually run the generator by removing the `--dry-run` flag.

```shell
npx nx g @nx/react:app apps/inventory
```
