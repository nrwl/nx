## Visualize your Project Structure

import { VideoLink } from '@nx/nx-dev/ui-markdoc';

Nx automatically detects the dependencies between the various parts of your workspace and builds a [project graph](/features/explore-graph). This graph is used by Nx to perform various optimizations such as determining the correct order of execution when running tasks like `npx nx build`, identifying [affected projects](/features/run-tasks#run-tasks-on-projects-affected-by-a-pr) and more. Interestingly you can also visualize it.

Just run:

```shell
npx nx graph
```

Notice how `shared-ui` is not yet connected to anything because we didn't import it in any of our projects.

Exercise for you: change the codebase such that `shared-ui` is used by `orders` and `products`. Note: you need to restart the `npx nx graph` command to update the graph visualization or run the CLI command with the `--watch` flag.
