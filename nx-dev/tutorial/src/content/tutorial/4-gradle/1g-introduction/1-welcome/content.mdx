# Gradle Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to add Nx to a repository with an existing Gradle setup.

What will you learn?

- how to add Nx to a Gradle project
- how to run a single task (i.e. serve your app) or run multiple tasks in parallel
- how to leverage code generators to scaffold components
- how to modularize your codebase and impose architectural constraints for better maintainability
- [how to speed up CI with Nx Cloud âš¡](/tutorials/4-gradle/3g-fast-ci/1-welcome)

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) installed on your system.
Consult [Gradle's installation guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html) for instruction that
are specific to your operating system.

To verify that Gradle was installed correctly, run this command:

```shell no-run
gradle --version
```

To streamline this tutorial, we'll install Nx globally on your system. You can use Homebrew (Mac only) or a manually installed Node version (any OS).

##### Homebrew

If installing Nx with Homebrew, make sure [Homebrew is installed](https://brew.sh/), then install Nx globally with these commands:

```shell no-run
brew tap nrwl/nx
brew install nx
```

##### Node

If installing Nx with Node, install node from the [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/download), then install Nx globally with this command:

```shell no-run
npm install --global nx
```

## Getting Started

This tutorial picks up where [Spring framework](https://spring.io/)'s guide for [Multi-Module Projects](https://spring.io/guides/gs/multi-module) leaves off.

Fork [the sample repository](https://github.com/nrwl/gradle-tutorial/fork), and then clone it on your local machine:

import { GithubRepository } from '@nx/nx-dev/ui-markdoc';

<GithubRepository url="https://github.com/nrwl/gradle-tutorial"></GithubRepository>

```shell no-run
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/gradle-tutorial.git
```

The Multi-Module Spring Tutorial left us with 2 projects:

- The main `application` project which contains the Spring `DemoApplication`
- A `library` project which contains a Service used in the `DemoApplication`

You can see the above 2 projects by running `./gradlew projects`

```shell no-run
./gradlew projects
```

```
> Task :projects

------------------------------------------------------------
Root project 'gradle-tutorial'
------------------------------------------------------------

Root project 'gradle-tutorial'
+--- Project ':application'
\--- Project ':library'

```
