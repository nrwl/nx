## Explore Your Workspace

Like Gradle, Nx understands your workspace as a graph of projects. Nx uses this graph for many things which we will
learn about in following sections. To visualize this graph in your browser, Run the following command and click the
"Show all projects" button in the left sidebar.

You will recognize that the projects which are shown, are the same projects which Gradle shows.
The `@nx/gradle` plugin reflects the graph of projects in Gradle into the Nx Project Graph. As projects
are created, deleted, and change their dependencies, Nx will automatically recalculate the graph. Exploring this graph
visually is vital to understanding how your code is structured and how Nx and Gradle behaves.

##### Mac/Linux

```shell no-run
./nx graph
```

##### Windows

```shell no-run
./nx.bat graph
```

##### Graph Result

import { Graph } from '@nx/nx-dev/ui-markdoc';

<div class="my-5">
  <Graph
    client:load
    title="Gradle Projects"
    height="200px"
    type="project"
    jsonFile="shared/tutorials/gradle-project-graph.json"
  />
</div>
