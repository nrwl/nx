## Run Tasks

Nx is a task runner built for monorepos. It can run a single task for a single project, a task for all projects, and
even intelligently run a subset of tasks based on the changes you've made in your repository. Nx also has sophisticated
computation caching to reuse the results of tasks. We will explore how Nx adds to the task running Gradle provides.

Before we start running tasks, let's explore the tasks available for the `application` project. The `@nx/gradle` plugin
that we've installed reflects Gradle's tasks to Nx, which allows it to run any of the Gradle tasks defined for that project. You can view the available tasks either through [Nx Console](/getting-started/editor-setup) or from the terminal:

```shell no-run
./nx show project application --web
```

import { ProjectDetails } from '@nx/nx-dev/ui-markdoc';

<div class="my-5">
  <ProjectDetails
    client:load
    title="Project Details View"
    jsonFile="shared/tutorials/gradle-pdv.json"
    expandedTargets={['build']}
    height="520px"
  />
</div>

The Nx command to run the `build` task for the `application` project is:

```shell no-run
./nx run application:build
```

When Nx runs a Gradle task, it hands off the execution of that task to Gradle, so all task dependencies and
configuration settings in the Gradle configuration are still respected.

By running the task via Nx, however, the task computation was cached for reuse. Now, running `./nx run application:build`
again, will complete almost instantly as the result from the previous execution will be used.

```shell no-run
./nx run application:build
```

```

   ✔  1/1 dependent project tasks succeeded [1 read from cache]

   Hint: you can run the command with --verbose to see the full dependent project outputs

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.

For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.5/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings in the Gradle documentation.

 NX   Successfully ran target build for project application and 3 tasks it depends on (30ms)

Nx read the output from the cache instead of running the command for 4 out of 4 tasks.
```

Now that we've run one task, let's run all the `build` tasks in the repository with the Nx `run-many` command. This is similar to Gradle's `./gradlew build` command.

```shell no-run
./nx run-many -t build
```

```

   ✔  nx run library:classes  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]
   ✔  nx run library:build  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]
   ✔  nx run application:classes  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]
   ✔  nx run application:build  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]
   ✔  nx run gradle-tutorial:classes (1s)
   ✔  nx run gradle-tutorial:build (1s)

 NX   Successfully ran target build for 3 projects and 3 tasks they depend on (2s)

Nx read the output from the cache instead of running the command for 4 out of 6 tasks.
```

Again, because Nx cached the tasks when the application was built, most of the tasks here were near instant. The only
ones which needed to be done is the root project's build. Running the command one more time, will be near instant as
then all the tasks will be restored from the cache.
