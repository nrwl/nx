## Sync TypeScript References

The `build` task for the `zoo` project has a [sync generator](/concepts/sync-generators) defined. The `@nx/js:typescript-sync` generator will automatically update the `references` property in the `tsconfig.json` files across the repository to match the actual dependencies in your code.

Let's see this behavior in action by extracting some common code into a new `util` library.

First, create a library with `@nx/js:lib` generator:

```shell
nx g @nx/js:lib packages/util
```

Set the bundler to `tsc`, the linter to `none` and the unit test runner to `none`.

Now we can move the `getRandomItem` function from `packages/names/names.ts` and `packages/animals/animals.ts` into the `packages/util/src/lib/util.ts` file.

```ts title="packages/util/src/lib/util.ts"
export function getRandomItem<T>(arr: T[]): T {
  return arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
}
```

```ts title="packages/animals/animals.ts"
import { getRandomItem } from '@tuskdesign/util';

// ...
```

```ts title="packages/names/names.ts"
import { getRandomItem } from '@tuskdesign/util';

// ...
```

Now if you run the build, Nx will notice that the TypeScript project references need to be updated and ask your permission to update them.

```shell
nx build @tuskdesign/zoo
```

```text
 NX   The workspace is out of sync

The @nx/js:typescript-sync sync generator identified 6 files in the workspace that are out of sync:
Based on the workspace project graph, some TypeScript configuration files are missing project references to the projects they depend on or contain outdated project references.

Please note that having the workspace out of sync will result in an error in CI.

? Would you like to sync the identified changes to get your workspace up to date? …
❯ Yes, sync the changes and run the tasks
  No, run the tasks without syncing the changes
```

Allow the sync to happen and you'll see that the `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.lib.json` files have been updated to include references to the new `util` library. With this system in place, no matter how your codebase changes, the TypeScript project references will always be correct.
