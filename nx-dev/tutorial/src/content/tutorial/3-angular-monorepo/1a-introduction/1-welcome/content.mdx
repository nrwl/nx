# Angular Monorepo Tutorial

In this tutorial you'll learn how to use Angular with Nx in a monorepo setup.

What will you learn?

- how to create a new Angular application
- how to run a single task (i.e. serve your app) or run multiple tasks in parallel
- how to leverage code generators to scaffold components
- how to modularize your codebase and impose architectural constraints for better maintainability
- [how to speed up CI with Nx Cloud ⚡](/tutorials/3-angular-monorepo/3a-fast-ci/1-welcome)

## Nx CLI vs. Angular CLI

Nx evolved from being an extension of the Angular CLI to a [fully standalone CLI working with multiple frameworks](/getting-started/why-nx#how-does-nx-work). As a result, adopting Nx as an Angular user is relatively straightforward. Your existing code, including builders and schematics, will still work as before, but you'll also have access to all the benefits Nx offers.

Advantages of Nx over the Angular CLI:

- [Cache any target](/features/cache-task-results)
- [Run only tasks affected by a code change](/ci/features/affected)
- [Split a large angular.json into multiple project.json files](/nx-api/angular/documents/nx-and-angular#projectjson-vs-angularjson)
- [Integrate with modern tools](/nx-api/angular/documents/nx-and-angular#integrating-with-modern-tools)
- [Controllable update process](/nx-api/angular/documents/nx-and-angular#ng-update-vs-nx-migrate)
