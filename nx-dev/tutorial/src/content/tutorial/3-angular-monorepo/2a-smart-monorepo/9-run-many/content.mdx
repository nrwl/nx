title: Run Multiple Tasks

### Running Multiple Tasks

In addition to running individual tasks, you can also run multiple tasks in parallel using the following syntax:

```shell
npx nx run-many -t test lint build
```

### Caching

One thing to highlight is that Nx is able to [cache the tasks you run](/features/cache-task-results).

Note that all of these targets are automatically cached by Nx. If you re-run a single one or all of them again, you'll see that the task completes immediately. In addition, (as can be seen in the output example below) there will be a note that a matching cache result was found and therefore the task was not run again.

```shell
npx nx run-many -t test lint build
```

```
...
   ✔  nx run inventory:lint  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]
   ✔  nx run ui:lint  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]
   ✔  nx run angular-store-e2e:lint  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]
   ✔  nx run inventory-e2e:lint  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]
   ✔  nx run ui:test  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]

NX   Successfully ran targets test, lint, e2e for 7 projects (279ms)

Nx read the output from the cache instead of running the command for 10 out of 10 tasks.
```

Not all tasks might be cacheable though. You can [configure which tasks are cacheable](/features/cache-task-results) in [the project configuration](/reference/project-configuration#cache) or in [the global Nx configuration](/reference/nx-json#cache). You can also [learn more about how caching works](/concepts/how-caching-works).
