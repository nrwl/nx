##### In-Browser Editing Tips

Instructions for each step will appear in this left-hand panel. You can edit files in the editor in the top right and execute terminal commands in the bottom right.

The file system and terminal will be reset at each step of the tutorial, so don't worry about breaking the workspace while experimenting. If you are stuck on a step, click the `Solve` button in the top right to set the file system to the solved state.

If you experience technical issues with the in-browser tutorial, try refreshing the page or use the download button in the top right to download the files for the current step to your local machine.

NX   Let's create a new workspace [https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro]

✔ Application name · angular-store
✔ Which bundler would you like to use? · esbuild
✔ Default stylesheet format · css
✔ Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)? · No
✔ Which unit test runner would you like to use? · jest
✔ Test runner to use for end to end (E2E) tests · cypress
✔ Which CI provider would you like to use? · github
```

Let's name the initial application `angular-store`. In this tutorial we're going to use `cypress` for e2e tests and `css` for styling. We'll talk more about how Nx integrates with GitHub Actions later in the tutorial. The above command generates the following structure:

```
└─ angular-monorepo
   ├─ ...
   ├─ apps
   │  ├─ angular-store
   │  │  ├─ public
   │  │  │  │  └─ favicon.ico
   │  │  ├─ src
   │  │  │  ├─ app
   │  │  │  │  ├─ app.config.ts
   │  │  │  │  ├─ app.css
   │  │  │  │  ├─ app.html
   │  │  │  │  ├─ app.routes.ts
   │  │  │  │  ├─ app.spec.ts
   │  │  │  │  ├─ app.ts
   │  │  │  │  └─ nx-welcome.ts
   │  │  │  ├─ index.html
   │  │  │  ├─ main.ts
   │  │  │  ├─ styles.css
   │  │  │  └─ test-setup.ts
   │  │  ├─ eslint.config.mjs
   │  │  ├─ jest.config.ts
   │  │  ├─ project.json
   │  │  ├─ tsconfig.app.json
   │  │  ├─ tsconfig.json
   │  │  └─ tsconfig.spec.json
   │  └─ angular-store-e2e
   │     └─ ...
   ├─ nx.json
   ├─ package.json
   └─ tsconfig.base.json
```

The setup includes:

- a new Angular application (`apps/angular-store/`)
- a Cypress based set of e2e tests (`apps/angular-store-e2e/`)
- Prettier preconfigured
- ESLint preconfigured
- Jest preconfigured

One way to structure an Nx monorepo is to place application projects in the `apps` folder and library projects in the `libs` folder. Applications are encouraged to be as light-weight as possible so that more code is pushed into libraries and can be reused in other projects. This folder structure is just a suggestion and can be modified to suit your organization's needs.

The [`nx.json` file](/reference/nx-json) contains configuration settings for Nx itself and global default settings that individual projects inherit. The `apps/angular-store/project.json` file contains [settings that are specific to the `angular-store` project](/reference/project-configuration). We'll examine that file more in the next section.
