## Imposing Constraints with Module Boundary Rules

import { VideoLink } from '@nx/nx-dev/ui-markdoc';

Once you modularize your codebase you want to make sure that the libs are not coupled to each other in an uncontrolled way. Here are some examples of how we might want to guard our small demo workspace:

- we might want to allow `orders` to import from `shared-ui` but not the other way around
- we might want to allow `orders` to import from `products` but not the other way around
- we might want to allow all libraries to import the `shared-ui` components, but not the other way around

When building these kinds of constraints you usually have two dimensions:

- **type of project:** what is the type of your library. Example: "feature" library, "utility" library, "data-access" library, "ui" library
- **scope (domain) of the project:** what domain area is covered by the project. Example: "orders", "products", "shared" ... this really depends on the type of product you're developing

Nx comes with a generic mechanism that allows you to assign "tags" to projects. "tags" are arbitrary strings you can assign to a project that can be used later when defining boundaries between projects. For example, go to the `project.json` of your `orders` library and assign the tags `type:feature` and `scope:orders` to it.

```json title="libs/orders/project.json"
{
  ...
  "tags": ["type:feature", "scope:orders"]
}
```

Then go to the `project.json` of your `products` library and assign the tags `type:feature` and `scope:products` to it.

```json title="libs/products/project.json"
{
  ...
  "tags": ["type:feature", "scope:products"]
}
```

Finally, go to the `project.json` of the `shared-ui` library and assign the tags `type:ui` and `scope:shared` to it.

```json title="libs/shared/ui/project.json"
{
  ...
  "tags": ["type:ui", "scope:shared"]
}
```

Notice how we assign `scope:shared` to our UI library because it is intended to be used throughout the workspace.

Next, let's come up with a set of rules based on these tags:

- `type:feature` should be able to import from `type:feature` and `type:ui`
- `type:ui` should only be able to import from `type:ui`
- `scope:orders` should be able to import from `scope:orders`, `scope:shared` and `scope:products`
- `scope:products` should be able to import from `scope:products` and `scope:shared`

To enforce the rules, Nx ships with a custom ESLint rule. Open the `.eslintrc.base.json` at the root of the workspace and add the following `depConstraints` in the `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` rule configuration:

```json title=".eslintrc.base.json"
{
  ...
  "overrides": [
    {
      ...
      "rules": {
        "@nx/enforce-module-boundaries": [
          "error",
          {
            "enforceBuildableLibDependency": true,
            "allow": [],
            "depConstraints": [
              {
                "sourceTag": "type:feature",
                "onlyDependOnLibsWithTags": ["type:feature", "type:ui"]
              },
              {
                "sourceTag": "type:ui",
                "onlyDependOnLibsWithTags": ["type:ui"]
              },
              {
                "sourceTag": "scope:orders",
                "onlyDependOnLibsWithTags": [
                  "scope:orders",
                  "scope:products",
                  "scope:shared"
                ]
              },
              {
                "sourceTag": "scope:products",
                "onlyDependOnLibsWithTags": ["scope:products", "scope:shared"]
              },
              {
                "sourceTag": "scope:shared",
                "onlyDependOnLibsWithTags": ["scope:shared"]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

To test it, go to your `libs/products/src/lib/products.tsx` file and import the `Orders` component from the `orders` project:

```tsx title="libs/products/src/lib/products.tsx"
import styles from './products.module.css';

// This import is not allowed ðŸ‘‡
import { Orders } from '@angular-monorepo/orders';

export function Products() {
  return (
    <div className={styles['container']}>
      <h1>Welcome to Products!</h1>
      <p>This is a change. ðŸ‘‹</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Products;
```

If you lint your workspace you'll get an error now:

```shell
npx nx run-many -t lint
```

```
