### Inferred Tasks

Nx identifies available tasks for your project from [tooling configuration files](/concepts/inferred-tasks), `package.json` scripts and the targets defined in `project.json`. All tasks from the `angular-store` project are defined in its `project.json` file, but the companion `angular-store-e2e` project has its tasks inferred from configuration files. To view the tasks that Nx has detected, look in the [Nx Console](/getting-started/editor-setup), [Project Details View](/recipes/nx-console/console-project-details) or run:

```shell
nx show project angular-store-e2e
```

If you expand the `e2e` task, you can see that it was created by the `@nx/cypress` plugin by analyzing the `apps/angular-store-e2e/cypress.config.ts` file. Notice the outputs are defined as:

```json
[
  "{workspaceRoot}/dist/cypress/apps/angular-store-e2e/videos",
  "{workspaceRoot}/dist/cypress/apps/angular-store-e2e/screenshots"
]
```

This value is being read from the `videosFolder` and `screenshotsFolder` defined by the `nxE2EPreset` in your `apps/angular-store-e2e/cypress.config.ts` file. Let's change their value in your `apps/angular-store-e2e/cypress.config.ts` file:

```ts title="apps/angular-store-e2e/cypress.config.ts" {8-10}
// ...
export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    ...nxE2EPreset(__filename, {
      // ...
    }),
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4200',
    videosFolder: '../dist/cypress/apps/angular-store-e2e/videos-changed',
    screenshotsFolder:
      '../dist/cypress/apps/angular-store-e2e/screenshots-changed',
  },
});
```

Now if you close the project details view (Ctrl-C in the terminal) and open it again, the outputs for the `e2e` target will be:

```json
[
  "{workspaceRoot}/apps/dist/cypress/apps/angular-store-e2e/videos-changed",
  "{workspaceRoot}/apps/dist/cypress/apps/angular-store-e2e/screenshots-changed"
]
```

This feature ensures that Nx will always cache the correct files.

You can also override the settings for inferred tasks by modifying the [`targetDefaults` in `nx.json`](/reference/nx-json#target-defaults) or setting a value in your [`project.json` file](/reference/project-configuration). Nx will merge the values from the inferred tasks with the values you define in `targetDefaults` and in your specific project's configuration.
