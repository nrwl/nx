### Explore Your Workspace

<!-- {% video-link link="https://youtu.be/ZA9K4iT3ANc?t=250" /%} -->

If you run `nx graph` as instructed, you'll see the dependencies between your projects.

```shell {% path="~/tuskydesigns" %}
npx nx graph --focus=@tuskdesign/zoo
```

Nx uses this graph to determine the order tasks are run and enforce module boundaries. You can also leverage this graph to gain an accurate understanding of the architecture of your codebase. Part of what makes this graph invaluable is that it is derived directly from your codebase, so it will never become out of date.
