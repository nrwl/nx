title: Nx Cloud CLI
description: Complete reference for all Nx Cloud CLI commands
---

The Nx Cloud command line interface provides various commands to connect and interact with Nx Cloud, manage distributed task execution, and handle authentication.
Below is a complete reference for all available commands and their options.

## Available Commands

### `nx-cloud login`

Provision a local personal access token to access Nx Cloud features. This will open your browser to the Nx Cloud application and after signing in will generate a personal access token and save it in a configuration file locally called `nxcloud.ini`.

This command is the same as running `nx login`.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx nx-cloud login [nxCloudUrl]
```

#### Options

| Option       | Type   | Description                                    | Default                |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `nxCloudUrl` | string | The URL of the Nx Cloud instance to connect to | `https://cloud.nx.app` |

#### Configuration File Location

{% tabs %}
{% tabitem label="macOS & Linux" %}

We look for this file at the following locations:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nxcloud/nxcloud.ini`
- `$HOME/config/nxcloud/nxcloud.ini`
- `$HOME/.nxcloud.ini`

If we don't find an existing config file, we create one at `$HOME/config/nxcloud/nxcloud.ini`

{% /tabitem %}
  {% tabitem label="Windows" %}

We look for this file within the `%LOCALAPPDATA%/nxcloud` directory and if it does not exist, we will create a new `nxcloud.ini` file there.

  {% /tabitem %}
{% /tabs %}
The format of this file is as follows:

```ini
[https://cloud\.nx\.app]
personalAccessToken=SOME_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

If you have access to multiple instances of the Nx Cloud application (e.g. self-hosted Enterprise and our managed instance), each instance will be saved to this file under its URL.

### `nx-cloud logout`

Revoke a personal access token from your local environment. This will remove the personal access token from the locally initialized configuration file and also invalidate the token from the Nx Cloud application. You will be prompted to remove a single token or all tokens from your local environment.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx nx-cloud logout
```

### `nx-cloud configure`

To provision more than one personal access token for multiple contexts (e.g. home and work machines) you can use the personal access tokens page under your Nx Cloud profile. To save a personal access token to your local `nxcloud.ini` file without needing to edit the file yourself call `nx-cloud configure`.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx nx-cloud configure
```

#### Options

| Option                  | Type   | Description                            | Default                |
| ----------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `--personalAccessToken` | string | The personal access token to configure |                        |
| `--nx-cloud-url`        | string | The URL of the Nx Cloud instance       | `https://cloud.nx.app` |

#### Examples

```bash
npx nx-cloud configure --personalAccessToken=SOME_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

To configure multiple tokens for different instances of the Nx Cloud app:

```bash
npx nx-cloud configure --personalAccessToken=SOME_ACCESS_TOKEN --nx-cloud-url=https://nx-cloud.my-domain.app
```

### `nx-cloud convert-to-nx-cloud-id`

When logging into Nx Cloud with a [Personal Access Token](/ci/recipes/security/personal-access-tokens), your `nx.json` file needs to include the `nxCloudId` property, which acts as a unique identifier for your workspace. If you have been using the previous `nxCloudAccessToken` to connect, simply run `npx nx-cloud convert-to-nx-cloud-id` to automatically update your configuration to use `nxCloudId`.

If you are connecting to Nx Cloud with a workspace that is version 19.6 or lower, this command will also install the latest version of the Nx Cloud npm package and add it into your `package.json`. Only Nx versions 19.7 and higher natively support the `nxCloudId` property in the `nx.json` file; for versions 19.6 and lower, the Nx Cloud npm package will be needed to use that property.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx nx-cloud convert-to-nx-cloud-id
```

### `nx-cloud start-ci-run`

At the beginning of your main job, invoke `npx nx-cloud start-ci-run`. This tells Nx Cloud that the following series of command correspond to the same CI run.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx nx-cloud start-ci-run
```

:::warning[Do not run start-ci-run locally]
`npx nx-cloud start-ci-run` generates a temporary marker file that can cause a local Nx repo to behave as if it is a part of a CI run. This can cause strange behavior like Nx commands timing out or throwing unexpected errors.
To discourage this from happening, this command will run a check to see if it is running in a CI environment. You can bypass this check with `npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --force`.

If you accidentally run this command locally, remove all generated marker files with `npx nx-cloud cleanup`.

#### Options

| Option                          | Type    | Description                                                                             | Default |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--distribute-on`               | string  | Configure the number of agents and launch templates for distributed execution           |         |
| `--require-explicit-completion` | boolean | Disable automatic completion monitoring and require explicit `nx-cloud complete-ci-run` | `false` |
| `--stop-agents-after`           | string  | Comma-separated list of targets after which agents should terminate                     |         |
| `--stop-agents-on-failure`      | boolean | Terminate all agents when a command fails                                               | `true`  |
| `--use-dte-by-default`          | boolean | Configure Nx to distribute all commands by default                                      | `true`  |
| `--with-env-vars`               | string  | Comma-separated list of environment variables to pass to Nx Agents                      |         |
| `--force`                       | boolean | Bypass CI environment check                                                             |         |

#### Detailed Option Usage

##### --distribute-on

By default, `npx nx-cloud start-ci-run` is intended for use with [Nx Agents](/ci/features/distribute-task-execution) and expects `--distribute-on` to be configured. It will output a warning if this flag is not set. If you are running a distributed execution with a legacy setup without Nx Agents, you can pass `--distribute-on=manual` to disable this warning.

This command tells Nx Cloud how many agents to use (and what launch templates to use) to distribute tasks. E.g.,
`npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --distribute-on="8 linux-medium-js"` will distribute CI using 8 agents that are initialized
using the `linux-medium-js` launch template.

You can also [define the configuration in a file](/ci/features/dynamic-agents) and reference it as follows:
`npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --distribute-on=".nx/workflows/dynamic-changesets.yaml"`.

```yaml 
// .nx/workflows/dynamic-changesets.yaml
distribute-on:
  small-changeset: 3 linux-medium-js
  medium-changeset: 6 linux-medium-js
  large-changeset: 10 linux-medium-js
```

##### --stop-agents-after

You can tell Nx Cloud to terminate agents after it sees a certain
target or group of targets: `npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --stop-agents-after=build,test,e2e`.

:::tip[Be as specific]
For the best results, always tell Nx Cloud about all targets that should be expected during your pipeline. This will
prevent your CI Pipeline Execution from ending prematurely, cutting off any unfinished work.
:::

Whether you are running commands serially or in parallel (through use of the `&` operand or discrete jobs), you should
include one or more targets from each command.

{% tabs %}
{% tabitem label="Serial command execution" %}

#### Incorrect example:

```yaml
- run: npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --stop-agents-after=build
- run: nx affected -t build
- run: nx affected -t lint
- run: nx affected -t test
```

Nx Cloud will only look for the presence of a `build` target before determining your pipeline can be shut down. Since
both `lint` and `test` will only run after `build` is complete, your pipeline would end before all intended work is
executed.

#### Corrected example:

```yaml
- run: npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --stop-agents-after=lint,test,build
- run: nx affected -t lint
- run: nx affected -t test
- run: nx affected -t build
```
  {% /tabitem %}
{% tabitem label="Parallel command execution" %}

#### Incorrect example:

```yaml
- run: npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --stop-agents-after=test
- run: nx affected -t build & nx affected -t lint & nx affected -t test
```

At first glance, this example may appear correct. However, since all the commands are executed in parallel, it could
be possible that your `test` command results in full cache hits and finishes faster than the `build` and `lint` commands.
In this case, Nx Cloud will stop your pipeline, leaving work incomplete for both the `build` and `lint` commands.

#### Corrected example:

```yaml
- run: npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --stop-agents-after=lint,test,build
- run: nx affected -t build & nx affected -t lint & nx affected -t test
```

{% /tabitem %}
{% /tabs %}

#### Advanced shutdown targeting

In advanced pipeline setups, it is possible that you want to run multiple commands with the same target, but with
distinct configurations. An example of this may be doing static translations for different locales during your builds.

```yaml
- run: npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --stop-agents-after=build
- run: nx affected -t build --configuration=locale-en
- run: nx affected -t build --configuration=locale-es
```

In this case, the `build` target will be executed twice, once with the `locale-en` configuration and once with the
`locale-es` configuration. However, Nx Cloud is only looking for the `build` target to assess whether the CI Pipeline
Execution can be marked complete.

To address this, you can pass an optional `configuration` to make your `target`s more specific.

```yaml
- run: npx nx-cloud start-ci-run --stop-agents-after=build:locale-en,build:locale-es
- run: nx affected -t build --configuration=locale-en
- run: nx affected -t build --configuration=locale-es
```

##### --with-env-vars (Nx Agents Only)

By default, invoking `npx nx-cloud start-ci-run` will take all environment variables prefixed with `NX_` and send them over to Nx Agents.
This means that your access token, verbose logging configuration and other Nx-related environment variables will be the same on your
main CI jobs and the Nx Agent machines.

If you want to pass other environment variables from the main job to Nx Agents, you can do it as follows: `--with-env-vars="VAR1,VAR2"`.
This will set `VAR1` and `VAR2` on Nx Agents to the same values set on the main job before any steps run.

> Note: none of the values passed to Nx Agents are stored by Nx Cloud.

#### Enabling/Disabling Distribution

Invoking `npx nx-cloud start-ci-run` will tell Nx to distribute by default. You can enable/disable distribution for
individual commands as follows:

{% tabs %}
{% tabitem  label="Nx >= 18" %}

- `nx affected -t build --agents` (explicitly enable distribution)
- `nx affected -t build --no-agents` (explicitly disable distribution)

{% /tabitem %}
{% tabitem  label="Nx >= 14.7" %}

- `nx affected -t build --dte` (explicitly enable distribution)
- `nx affected -t build --no-dte` (explicitly disable distribution)

{% /tabitem %}
{% /tabs %}

### `nx-cloud stop-all-agents`

Same as `npx nx-cloud complete-ci-run`.

This command tells Nx Cloud to terminate all agents associated with this CI pipeline execution.
Invoking this command is not needed anymore. New versions of Nx Cloud can track when the main job terminates
and terminate associated agents automatically.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx nx-cloud stop-all-agents
```

### `nx-cloud complete-ci-run`

Explicitly complete a CI run when using `--require-explicit-completion` with `start-ci-run`.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx nx-cloud complete-ci-run
```

### `nx-cloud cleanup`

Remove temporary marker files created by `start-ci-run` if accidentally run locally.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx nx-cloud cleanup
```
