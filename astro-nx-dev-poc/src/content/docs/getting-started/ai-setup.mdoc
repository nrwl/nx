# Integrate Nx with your Coding Assistant

Nx provides deep integration with AI coding assistants through the **Nx Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**, giving your AI assistant comprehensive understanding of your monorepo structure, running processes, and development workflows.

## Setup and Configuration

### Automatic Setup with Nx Console

Make sure you have **Nx Console** [installed in your editor](/getting-started/editor-setup), as it automatically exposes the Nx MCP server. Once Nx Console is installed and you open an Nx workspace, you'll receive a notification to **"Improve Copilot/AI agent with Nx-specific context"** - click **"Yes"** to automatically configure it.

If you miss the notification, you can manually run the configuration by opening the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`) and running `nx.configureMcpServer`.

### Manual Setup for Other AI Clients

For MCP-compatible clients like **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, or other AI assistants, add the following configuration:

```json
// mcp.json
{
  "servers": {
    "nx-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["nx-mcp@latest", "/path/to/your/workspace"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/workspace` with your actual workspace path.

## What This Integration Enables

The Nx AI integration provides your coding assistant with powerful capabilities:

- **[Workspace Structure Understanding](/blog/nx-mcp-vscode-copilot)** - Deep architectural awareness of your monorepo, project relationships, and dependencies
- **[Real-time Terminal Integration](/blog/nx-terminal-integration-ai)** - AI can read your terminal output, running processes, and error messages without copy-pasting
- **[CI Pipeline Context](/blog/nx-editor-ci-llm-integration)** - Access to build failures, test results, and deployment status from your CI/CD processes
- **[Enhanced Code Generation](/blog/nx-generators-ai-integration)** - AI-powered generator suggestions and custom scaffolding with intelligent defaults
- **Cross-project Impact Analysis** - Understanding the implications of changes across your entire monorepo
- **Autonomous Error Debugging** - AI independently accesses context to help fix development issues
