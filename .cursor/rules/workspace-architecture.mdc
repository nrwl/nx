## Nx Documentation Overview

The main application is a Next.js based application living under `nx-dev/nx-dev`. Look at the `nx-dev/nx-dev/pages` folder in particular to understand the routing structure of the Next application. It leverages packages from other libraries in `nx-dev/` such as `nx-dev/data-access-documents` or `nx-dev/data-access-menu` etc.

### Navigation structure

The navigation structure is given by the route-based navigation of the main Next.js app living in `nx.dev/nx-dev/pages` and `nx-dev/nx-dev/app`. In addition, paths that map to the documentation content file are defined in [map.json](mdc:docs/map.json).

**When updating the navigation structure (e.g. changing `map.json` within the `nx-documentation` node), you must also update [redirect-rules.js](mdc:nx-dev/nx-dev/redirect-rules.js) and [menu.utils.ts](mdc:nx-dev/data-access-menu/src/lib/menu.utils.ts) as an integral part of the change.**
- This ensures correct navigation, avoids broken links, and preserves SEO.
- Updates to these files are not separate tasks, but must always be performed together with any navigation change in `map.json`.
- See the implementation plan in [DOCS_RESTRUCTURE_TASKS.md](mdc:scripts/AI/docs-restructure/DOCS_RESTRUCTURE_TASKS.md) for more details.

### Documentation content

The actual documentation is written in markdown in "docs/".

It is being copied to `nx-dev/nx-dev/public/documentation` by the `copy-docs` task defined in [project.json](mdc:nx-dev/nx-dev/project.json).
